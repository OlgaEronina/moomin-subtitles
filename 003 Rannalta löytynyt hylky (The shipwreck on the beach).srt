1
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Peace has come back to Moomin Valley again. No worries are to be seen.

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,000
Or, just wait a moment...

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
MoominTroll! MoominTroll wait!

4
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,800
Mother! Mother, are they ready?
- Is what ready?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,800
The pancakes!
- Not ready yet. The Magician's wood doesn't burn well.

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
You're only making the dough now...

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Pancakes don't take long.
- Are the pancakes ready?!

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
There's not much to worry about...

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,000
I am a fool! Stupid!
- No you're not. You are wise.

10
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm a rotten egg! Dumb!
- Your machine goes well on the land, right?

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,500
If you can design a machine that moves on land you can surely make one that flies. I believe in you.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm not much good for anything...

13
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,000
Last night I thought I finally succeeded with the flying machine.

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
But then I looked at my papers and I thought how can I be so simple minded when I'm so intelligent!

15
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm a complete fool...

16
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,000
The pancakes are ready. Go and tell everyone.
- I can go.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Where are MoominTroll and Snork Maiden?
- Snork Maiden is crying again.

18
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't take it so seriously. Inventors get depressed when their inventions don't work.

19
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,000
MoominPappa also invents stories, right? 
- Yes, or memorials.

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
Snork Maiden, would you like a pancake?
- Yes please!

21
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,000
MoominTroll, go and get your Father. He is stuck again with his writing.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Snork Maiden, what's wrong?

23
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,000
When the morning came the sun rolled on the eastern side of the sky and slowly everything got brighter...

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,500
Even the stupidest reader knows that... Oh I don't have any writing skills...

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm not a professional... I better quit...

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come in!

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Father?
- What is it?

28
00:04:010,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mother says the pancakes are ready.
- I'm fighting with creativity. I'll come later.

29
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Did you have anything else?
- No. Yes... Maybe I misheard...

30
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,000
MoominTroll! Wait, I will come!

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That tasted good. I will go out!

32
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,000
I will come too.
- No, Snufkin and I are going on a dangerous adventure.

33
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, Snufkin!
- Hey you, I thought you were never coming.

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
What's that?
- A leaf boat. It sails down the river.

35
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,000
It goes all the way to the ocean and washes on the shore of unknown lands. 
- One day I will make a boat trip too.

36
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,000
Are we ready to go?
- Little My wants to come too but I said it's too dangerous.

37
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You should have chosen your words more carefully. Look!

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey, wait! These ones also need excitement in their lives!
- Wait! 

39
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Are we really going to climb on top of that mountain?
- I don't think we can manage it?

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm not going up...
- But I am!

41
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Wouldn't you rather keep me company?
- Couldn't you girls just wait for us in the cave next to the path?

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Couldn't you just walk along the path?
- Girls have difficulty understanding these things.

43
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,000
Boys are difficult to understand.

44
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
We want to climb.
- Let's go already.

45
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you coming with us, Sniff?
- I'll protect the cave from below.

46
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Coward...
- Don't underestimate me. Someone has to stay with the girls.

47
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
Should we go into the cave?
- I don't feel like going in...

48
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:58,000
It's better to stay here. You never know who lives in a cave.
- You fools, there's no one living in there!

49
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Exactly. That's why I don't feel like going in.
- Uninhabited places are horrifying...

50
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think we should be right above the cave but I don't see the hole.
- Maybe it's a bit further.

51
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:28,000
Wow! I've never seen seashells like these before! This has to be valuable! Little My, come here!

52
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,000
Where is Little My?
- She went into the cave.

53
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,900
Horrible... She should come and pick the seashells.

54
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Little My! Come out!
- Come on you coward!

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's dangerous to just go in like that.

56
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,2 00
Then how on earth would you get in?
- Wait there. We will come and save you.

57
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,000
Aren't you coming with me, Snork Maiden?

58
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,000
Yea... I think so...
- Well let's go then.

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll take your hand in case you start to be afraid.

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Where are you, Little My? Answer!

61
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,500
You'll make Snork Maiden afraid!

62
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, I thought I'll make you scared. Your voice is shaking.
- My voice sounds like this all the time!

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,500
Shh, I hear something...

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I hear something too. Maybe the wind?
- It sounds like someone is sobbing.

65
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't scare me! No one is living here!

66
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:59,000
It's just Snufkin and MoominTroll. They have come down into the cave.
- Why would they sob? It has to be someone else.

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, stop Little My!

68
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Pull now, MoominTroll.
- Is it okay now?

69
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,500
Which one of us goes first?
- Me.

70
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Be careful.
- Understood.

71
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,500
Take it easy. There's no hurry.

72
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey, are you okay?
- Of course!

73
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,500
MoominTroll! Are you okay?
- I think so. But, my bottom hurts...

74
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,500
Who screamed?
- Our friend Hemulin was here taking a nap.

75
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, heavens...

76
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,800
Are you playing games again?!
- We didn't know you were here taking a nap.

77
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't lay down for a nap.
- Then what were you doing here?

78
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,500
To be honest, I haven't been myself lately.
- Have you lost a rare stamp again?

79
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,800
On the contrary, I have them all. Every single stamp that a collector can have.

80
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Then what's wrong?
- My stamp collection is perfect.

81
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,000
No one has a better collection than you.

82
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course not, mine is the best. There are no rarities that I don't own.

83
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Then I don't understand.
- You are too young to understand. And besides, you are not collectors.

84
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm starting to get it...
- What?

85
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Hemulin is no longer a collector, just an owner, and it's not nearly as fun.
- The fun is gone...

86
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,900
Ah, you have tense nerves and me falling on your neck didn't make you feel better.
- Honestly speaking, no.

87
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hemulin was taking a nap in the cave.
- Poor Hemulin.

88
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,900
Hah! The ghost sobbing was Hemulin snoring.

89
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,800
I never snore!
- Yes you do!

90
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,500
If you don't tell anyone I will show you an extraordinary thing...
- What is it?

91
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh boy!
- Is that it?

92
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Isn't it gorgeous?
- It's beautiful!

93
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
I wonder if someone owns it.

94
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Maybe it could be fixed.
- Of course, and it's not even difficult.

95
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,200
You never know... The bottom seems rotten.
- I'm sure it's sailable.

96
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
The sail has holes in it.
- The oars are missing.

97
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,500
We don't need them, we will row with our hands.
- You will!

98
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Look out! The boat is tipping!

99
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I have lost my self confidence and it feels so bad...
- That could happen to anyone.

100
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,800
To you too?
- Yes, but not very often.

101
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:41,000
How can I get my self confidence back?
- I don't know, mine usually comes with time.

102
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,900
I doubt I will ever make another contraption...
- I think I will leave the memoirs for a while.

103
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
What's wrong with both of you? You look so gloomy.

104
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was too confident.
- Me too.

105
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Hey! Moominpappa! Moominpappa!
- What's wrong, Nipsu? We can hear you without howling...

106
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Come quickly! We have found a boat at the shore!

107
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, did you find a shipwreck on the shore?
- No. it's a real boat. It has a sail!

108
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We will fix the boat and then it will be ours.

109
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm coming. Come Snork, an adventure is what you need now.
- Yea, maybe. I could be interested in a boat if it has a sail.

110
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hmm, yes, a brisk little boat...
- It has a good shape.

111
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,000
Dad, isn't it ours because it is abandoned?

112
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hmm, maybe it has been left here because it leaks.

113
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,500
That would be understandable.
- Yes, but finders always become owners!

114
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Well it's not always like that. First we have to wait a little.
- Then what we will we do, father?

115
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,500
Well we have to fix the boat so we can anchor it if a storm surprises us.

116
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:35,000
Of course!
- But if the owner shows up I don't think we will give up on the boat... It might be that no one actually knows where the boat is.

117
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:42,500
What will we do after we fix it?
- Pity those boats that are left on the shore. What about sailing the seven seas?

118
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,500
I want to see the rest of the world.
- I also want to look around.

119
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,800
And you don't have to be afraid. If we encounter big waves we just sail between them, right Moominpappa?

120
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Just like that. Okay, my friends, let's begin. Will you help with the planning, Snork?
- Yes of course.

121
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
Moominpappa, can I do something?
- Would you really like to?

122
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,200
Well if you don't mind, but I'm not that handy...

123
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,000
But first we have to draw it in the sand.
- Yea! Let's do it!

124
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:28,200
We need at least 10 logs under the boat.
- Yea we're going!

125
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Then we need a few bigger logs for support.

126
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,600
We also need lots of nails.
- That's true, and also a bucket and hand bailer.

127
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,600
I'll help to pick up the nails because it's a difficult thing.
- And I will look after the boat in case the owner shows up.

128
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,200
The sails...
- What?

129
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Are the kids asleep already?
- They sleep like logs.

130
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,000
No wonder, they worked so hard.

131
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't wait until we sail somewhere.
- Oh, I'll take you anywhere in the world! Anywhere!

132
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't fancy going far.
- Should we go to sleep? It's an early morning tomorrow... Oh working outside is hard.

133
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,500
It's going to be okay.
- Poor thing, sailing will do good for you...

134
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Good job, If I say so myself.
- And now the rest...

135
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,700
Listen, Moomintroll, I will tar the boat.
- Yea yea, I will just tar where you can't reach.

136
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:51,000
Sniff, go and get some more tar for us.
- Huh, go and get it yourself! I let you tar the boat only because you wanted to.

137
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Getting the tar is not my job! Go on and stop whining!

138
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,900
Should I cut it from here, Moominmamma?
- Yes, right there.

139
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,000
What's wrong, Hemmulin?
- The boat things seem be progressing quickly.

140
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,500
Yes it's going to be ready soon.
- That's what I was afraid of...

141
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,500
What am I supposed to do then?
- Can't you find another thing to collect?

142
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Like what?
- Anything. Collect butterflies...

143
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,500
No way. My cousin collects them and he's a total fool.

144
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,700
Decorations?
- Decorations!

145
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You could collect them forever.
- Unscientific!

146
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,800
I really think you should start collecting something.

147
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Hurry up! We are going to christen the boat!
- I'm coming! I'm coming!

148
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You fixed the sail really well. Come!

149
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Are you ready? Push! One, two, three!

150
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:58,000
When the boat was fixed and the previous owner had not shown up Moomintroll started to get excited about the upcoming trip. Even Sniff and Hemulin were in good spirits.

151
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,000
And now for a test sailing...
