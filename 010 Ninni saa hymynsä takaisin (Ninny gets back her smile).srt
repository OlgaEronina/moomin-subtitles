1
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,800
Hey! Where is Ninny?

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,700
Ninny told us she wants to play with us.

3
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,000
Ninny, come have fun with us!

4
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
Let's go already.

5
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Because of her ironical Aunt, the invisible Ninny could now be seen up to her neck, but the head refused to appear even though Moominmamma poured grandma's medicine on her.

6
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Look, an invisible child.
- I wonder what she looks like?

7
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Good morning everyone!
- You little lumpsucker! It's past 12PM!

8
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,000
We are going to play hide and seek in the forest.
- Wonderful. How is it going, Ninny?
-- Good.

9
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,200
This is dumb, if I was able to see you, I wouldn't have to ask.
- For your part, you look always dumb.

10
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,100
This place is big for hide and seek.

11
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
The bigger it is the more exciting it'll be.

12
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's, however, follow this new rule...
- Which one?

13
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,400
That you can't change your hiding spot in the middle of the game. Do you get it Ninny?

14
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Sniff, you'll be the first one to count.
- Why is it always me?

15
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,800
We have to practice because Ninny is with us.

16
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,400
There's no need to practice playing hide and seek.

17
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,300
Look, Ninny has never played hide and seek.
- Oh! She hasn't?

18
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,100
Ninny has never played hide and seek, and nothing else either.

19
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,200
Not even when she was visible?
- No...

20
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
Oh dear.

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,300
Is it okay that you stay and be the seeker?
- I won't.

22
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,100
Alright then, I'll stay.

23
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll slowly count to 10 so that you have time to hide.

24
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
1... 2...

25
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
Go hide quickly, Ninny!

26
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,000
3...

27
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,800
4!

28
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,100
Go further!

29
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,300
5...

30
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,400
6...

31
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
7...

32
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,100
8...

33
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,300
9...

34
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,500
Hey, Ninny! Don't be afraid of me. Go hide behind that bush.
- 10!

35
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,500
I'll start to search!
- Thank you.

36
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,900
I found you Sniff!

37
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
My has been found!

38
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I wonder where Ninny has hid?

39
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,300
I found you! You had a good hiding spot but I saw your bow.

40
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,200
Only Snorkmaiden left but she's never hard to find.

41
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,200
Snorkmaiden wants to be found.
- I found Snorkmaiden!

42
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
3...

43
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
4...

44
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,600
5...
- This is my bush!

45
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,350
6...

46
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
7...

47
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Hey Ninny, I know a good spot for you, they'll never find you there!

48
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,400
The opening is a bit tight, but the cavern widens further in.

49
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,200
Hurry up or Sniff will find you!

50
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,200
There you go! Now when you stay there until tomorrow you'll turn entirely invisible!

51
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,900
I want out!
- Tomorrow we'll go rob the bank together!

52
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,200
I don't want to!

53
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,700
Let me out!

54
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,700
You'll get half... Ehm, a quarter of the loot!

55
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,800
It was such a good idea to bring Ninny here.
- Good to hear you think so, Too-ticky.

56
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,600
You people are so extraordinary that your peculiar behaviour might turn Ninny back visible again and of course you are very friendly!

57
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Well thank you, I guess we should be flattered.
- Absolutely.

58
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:27,100
By the way, Ninny is speaking already. Her voice is very delicate though.
- Has her voice always been like that?

59
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,700
Who knows, that might be.

60
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,200
Otherwise many people get by well without using their heads.

61
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,000
It's nice that Ninny has playmates. She hasn't had those before at all!

62
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,300
But... I don't think she knows how to play.

63
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,500
I think that some kind of shock would do her good.

64
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,700
I found you!
- Ugh, there were spikes in the bush anyway.

65
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,900
Well I was found the last.
- Ninny is still missing.
-- Really?

66
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You hid in the same bush as Ninny?

67
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,300
Well, Ninny is very skilled.

68
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,400
Oh well, maybe Ninny is lost.

69
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,500
I've been looking everywhere but she's gone invisible again and that's why I can't find her.

70
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
Sniff is in serious trouble.

71
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,800
I wonder where Ninny might be?
- I don't know, I haven't seen her.

72
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Ninny, come out! We're going home!

73
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,100
Ninny! Ninny!
- Where on the earth is she?

74
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,200
Your job is to find her.
- Not anymore when we've stopped playing the game!

75
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,800
I think we have to find Ninny. Let's all help look for her.

76
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Ohoy, Ninny, come out! The game is over!

77
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,100
Ninny! We're going home to drink juice and eat cookies!

78
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Ninny! Ninny! Ninny, where are you?

79
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:26,300
We weren't supposed to go this far to hide.
- Listen! Maybe Ninny really is lost.

80
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,800
Ninny! Ninny! Come out!

81
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,800
Ninny!
- Help me, I'm here!

82
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Huh? Did you hear something?
- Maybe.

83
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,100
I'm here!

84
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Ninny's voice!

85
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's coming from a close range.
Ninny, where are you?

86
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,800
Here! Inside the rocks!

87
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Ninny can't be far!
- Let's hurry

88
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,000
Ninny! I couldn't hear what you said! Where are you?

89
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,400
I am here! Here!

90
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Getting hotter, hotter... Say it louder!
- Inside the rocks!

91
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,500
Say it once more!
- Here inside the rocks!

92
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,000
There!

93
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh my, I have never yelled so loud...

94
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Ninny, are you trapped behind this rock?

95
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,100
I am. Stinky closed the opening.

96
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
We'll get you out! Let's move the boulder.

97
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,900
Are you okay?
- I am, Moomintroll. Thank you.

98
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Your voice is stronger.
- Returned.
-- Is that so?

99
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,700
Take my hand and I'll pull you out.
- I'm coming.

100
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,500
What has happened?
- Ninny was inside the hole of this rock.

101
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Great! Ninny found an excellent hiding place!

102
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,900
Did I say something funny?

103
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,300
Nifty to think about Ninny robbing a bank.

104
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:39,100
I guess...
- Stinky was quite the shock to Ninny. But she didn't turn invisible after all and her voice is a lot louder now.

105
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,200
Ninny yelled as loud as she could.
- Did you really yell that loud?

106
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,800
I did. Moomintroll told me to yell so he could hear where I was.

107
00:13:49,900 --> 00:14:00,200
And loud you yelled.
- Good Ninny! Those who speak up loudly are usually also seen well. Remember that!

108
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Yell! I want to see you.

109
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Good thinking, and try to get angry too! Too-Ticky would be delighted if you could turn visible again.

110
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Get angry to Stinky!
- Stinky is so horrible!

111
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,100
He should not be! He better watch his back!

112
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,100
Stinky! Wait!

113
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
You will not catch me!

114
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Stinky! I need to speak with you!

115
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
I have nothing to say to you!

116
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
Are you hurt?

117
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,400
Stinky, you will not get away!
- The woods are my homefield! You will not catch me here!

118
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,500
You can't do this to me!
- We'll do the same to you as what you did to Ninny.

119
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I needed Ninny's help.
- She didn't want to help!

120
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,800
I shut her down here so she could change her mind.

121
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,600
And would be so shocked that she would turn entirely invisible!

122
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,500
My plan demanded her being invisible. Let me out!

123
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
Not a chance. Till tomorrow!

124
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,000
You crooks! You're doing this out of spite!

125
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,700
This will be remembered!

126
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,400
In spite of all, Ninny's face was still invisible.

127
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,400
Then, around 10 days later...

128
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,600
Nails bounce out on a weather like this!

129
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,100
I've never seen anyone stare at the sea like that.

130
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
I guess Ninny has never seen the ocean.

131
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,100
Well, now she's weeping.

132
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,700
Ninny, what's wrong?
- The ocean is too big, way too big.

133
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,500
You don't have to go to the ocean, do you?

134
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
Hey, Moominmamma!
- Yes?

135
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,300
What's wrong with Ninny?
There's nothing wrong with her. She's just astonished about the size of the ocean.

136
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Well, there is an awful lot of water in the ocean...

137
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:22,600
Me on the other hand, I haven't been astonished or nervous of anything for weeks.

138
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,800
Mom is bored.
- Seems so.

139
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:33,100
Mom is never bored.
- Now she clearly is! She wishes that something surprising would happen.

140
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,500
You think so?
- We have to set up a surprise for her.

141
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,300
What kind of a surprise?
- So that she's really surprised!

142
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,200
Dad, don't tell me you're going to push her into the ocean?
- What would be a better surprise?

143
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,300
But the water is freezing.
- When we were young the water was never too cold for us!

144
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,200
Did you push each other into the ocean?
- All the time!

145
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,500
Dad?
- What?
-- Nothing...

146
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Don't worry, your Mother will think it's very funny.

147
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
You can't!

148
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,300
Don't you dare to push Moominmamma into the ocean!

149
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Let me explain!

150
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,800
There's nothing to explain you meany! Moominmamma would get drenched!

151
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
You can't do it!

152
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,900
Ninny!

153
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Ninny is visible!

154
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
How fun!

155
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Finally we can see Ninny!

156
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,700
Pappa, did something happen?
- Not really... She's the most wicked and sharp toothed child I've ever seen.

157
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
I finally turned visible!

158
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Yeah, and you won't disappear again!

159
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,800
Not ever!

160
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Brisk girl, and has seemingly good teeth.

161
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,700
Ninny, I'm so happy!

162
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,800
Ninny!

163
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,900
Mamma!

164
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm happy too.

165
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't laugh at me you wretched brat, saw-toothed monster!

166
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
What is so funny?

167
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,700
Did Ninny really laugh?

168
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,800
You have truly changed her.
- Indeed. She's almost as bad as Little My.

169
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:04,000
I have never heard Ninny laugh, but the best thing is still that she has turned back visible.

170
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Ninny!
- Too-Ticky!

171
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,500
And so Too-Ticky took Ninny as she had brought her, but now Ninny was visible and was anything but shy.

172
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,100
Ninny was said to be ready for anything, except going back to her Aunt.
