# English subtitles for The Moomins (Muumilaakson Kevät)

Translating The Moomins cartoon is an ongoing project as I want to watch it in its native language and learn some Finnish along the way. I couldn't find more than a dozen subtitled episodes, uploaded to various websites, so I decided to find a few interested people and make our own translations.

## Usage

The subtitles are standard [.SRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) files. They can be used best in [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). The episodes, however, are up to you to find!
