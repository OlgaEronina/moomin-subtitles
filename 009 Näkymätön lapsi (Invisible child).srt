1
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,500
Well, hurry up! That over there is the Moomin House!

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
On that day it started to rain in the early afternoon.

3
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Everyone was shivering inside when Too-Ticky came.

4
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,800
Good evening, Moomintroll.
- Hi, come in!

5
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
Mother, Too-Ticky is here.

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Ninny, please come in.

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
Aren't you alone?
- No. I have Ninny with me.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Ninny?

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
Come in!

10
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
There's nobody out there...
- Believe me, she's there even if you don't see her.

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Is she?
- Yes. She is just really shy.

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,500
I'll leave the door open so you can come in when you are ready.

13
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,100
She's going to get wet.
- Maybe. It doesn't matter if you are invisible.

14
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh, Too-Ticky! Fun!

15
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
What is everybody staring at?

16
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:20,600
You know that if someone gets very badly scared they can turn invisible, right?

17
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,600
The Aunt has taken care of Ninny out of obligation.

18
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,800
The Aunt doesn't like her at all. She is behaving badly.

19
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,900
The Aunt doesn't get angry or yell. You would understand that.

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,800
She's just ice cold and sarcastic. It's terrible. Just terrible.

21
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
What does sarcastic mean?

22
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,600
Well, think if you fall and land in the middle of a coffee table. What would your mother do?

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
She would ask if I got hurt.

24
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:05,500
This Aunt would say: "This may be dancing to you but don't dance in the food." That's sarcasm.

25
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,700
That's nasty.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,500
She was really sarcastic. All day, every day.

27
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:22,000
So eventually Ninny started to fade away until last Friday when she disappeared entirely.

28
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,400
That's terrible!

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,800
The aunt gave Ninny to me because she said she cannot take care of invisible relatives.

30
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,000
So what did you do with the Aunt? Did you smack her?

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That doesn't work with sarcastic people.

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,000
I took Ninny and brought her here so you would make her visible again.

33
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,700
Very flattering, but...
- If someone can do it Moominmamma can. And Moomintroll can play with her.

34
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,600
Too-Ticky, does Ninny speak?
- No, unfortunately not.

35
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh dear.
- What can we play then? She will be invincible if we play hide-and-seek.

36
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,300
The aunt put a bell on her neck. You will hear where she goes.

37
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh the door opened.
- It must be Ninny!

38
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
Come out from the rain, Ninny.

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Moomin House is your new home. The Moomins are very kind.

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is Moominpappa, this is Moominmamma and this is--
- Snorkmaiden, My, Sniff and Moomintroll.

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
We're just having tea. Would you like to have some if you can drink?

42
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,300
I'll bring you juice.

43
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,100
I would like to see how the juice moves inside of her. This way, Ninny.

44
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Well that's all. Unfortunately I can't tell you more about her. You'll be fine.
- It's going to be okay.

45
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Here you go, Ninny.

46
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, I'll be going now. There are lots of things to do at home. I'll come by every now and then to see how you are doing.

47
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Sounds like a plan.

48
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,000
What now?
- It just came to my mind, did you have some extra visitors here?

49
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,900
Yes we had. Thingummy and Bob. They moved out last week.
- Yea, that's good.

50
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
You drank it all! Do you want some more?

51
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I hope it was good.

52
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,500
Ninny, will you come upstairs with me? The bell is pretty.

53
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,700
This is your room.

54
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,600
I'll leave some juice on the night table so you can drink whenever you want.

55
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Are you ready to go to bed?

56
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:10,600
Just tuck yourself in. Ninny, if you start feeling lonely during the night you can come and wake me up.

57
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,800
Well then, ring your bell.

58
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Good night.

59
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,300
Is she asleep?
- Yes.

60
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Maybe we can find a cure for her from your grandmothers notebook, called "Guaranteed Home Medicine".

61
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,800
I wonder if there is a medicine for invisibility. I don't remember but we can check.

62
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
I believe there is a medicine.

63
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
I know that, my darling. I will go and check.

64
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,700
I want to see Ninny.

65
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,500
There it is. Bad eye... Depression... Limp tail...

66
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Ah here it is!

67
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,900
The recipe was written at the end of the notebook.

68
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,400
It was the right one because it said: "The cure is if someone starts being foggy and difficult to see."

69
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I hope it works.

70
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,200
Grandmother's recipes always work.

71
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes, I know. I wonder if she is still asleep.

72
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
Look! I can see her shoes!

73
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Moominpappa!

74
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,800
Morning, My.

75
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is she up yet?
- Yes, yes.

76
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
Where is she? I hope she hasn't eaten yet!

77
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,600
I think she is in the dining hall.

78
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Where is she?

79
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,600
Be quiet! Ninny is taking medicine.

80
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
One sip, for Moomintroll.

81
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,600
There you go. It should activate in 2 hours.

82
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Her shoes are floating!
- Yes, her shoes are visible now.

83
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,900
Look! They look funny!
- She has beautiful feet.

84
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,400
I doubt Moominmamma's medicines take effect that fast.

85
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
You must look ugly because you prefer to be invisible.

86
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,300
Don't mind Little My, she always talks like that.

87
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,900
I still can't see how the food flows inside of her.

88
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
What shall we do?

89
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Go pick mushrooms.
- Boring. I never find any.

90
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
I do. Ninny, shall we go?

91
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,100
Decided. Who will pick up the most?

92
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,800
You need to tell me which mushrooms are edible.

93
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,400
We will.

94
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Father! Father! Look! Her shoes are visible!

95
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,000
Moominmamma's medicines are known for their effectiveness.

96
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,700
It can't be the medicine.

97
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,500
I think the medicine took effect faster because of a missing body.

98
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Or because the aunt is far away.

99
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,100
Could be.

100
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,600
Mother! We will take Ninny to pick mushrooms.

101
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,200
Wonderful.

102
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Morning!

103
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,800
Morning!

104
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Where is she?

105
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Awesome! You're good at this!

106
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Lots of mushrooms!

107
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,700
I only have half.

108
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,700
How many have you got, Moomintroll?

109
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
4 times as much as I have!

110
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,500
You have never picked up so many before.

111
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
There is something rotten in here...

112
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,300
Oh, they were Ninny's mushrooms!
- Yea, they were.

113
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,200
The awful aunt never let her go mushroom picking so she has the drive now.

114
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,900
But I bet she only had permission to carry a basket.

115
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,500
How terrible! How terrible!

116
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Stinky.

117
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
What does he want?

118
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,800
Shall I bite him?

119
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,000
We haven't seen in a long time!
- And I wouldn't care. Last time you dunked my bathing suit in glue!

120
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,300
That was funny!

121
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,700
How is the basket floating?

122
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,900
I don't want to be rude but I won't tell.

123
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,100
I wonder what you could do if you were invisible.

124
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Ninny, I'll take your basket. Let's go.

125
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
Come on, Ninny!

126
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,200
Hey! Is Ninny your real name or the species?

127
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,300
Stinky! Stop right now! You'll scare her!

128
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Is she a female? Ninny, right? That's a nerdy name.

129
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
Beware, Stinky.

130
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
What is it now?

131
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,500
Do not pick on Ninny or I'll get mad.

132
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,800
Without the shoes she would be a good bank robber.

133
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,700
Don't even think about it. She's going to turn visible soon. Yesterday we started to see her feet.

134
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
And now they are fading again.

135
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,300
Stinky! It was you!

136
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,500
Tell Moominmamma and Moominpappa she will be a good bank robber!

137
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,700
She won't do that! Besides, we're going to make her visible!

138
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,200
She has already taken mother's magical medicine!

139
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Who's is this?

140
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Me and My's.

141
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,700
Oh dear, very beautiful.

142
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,900
We didn't find much because Ninny picked up most of the mushrooms.

143
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,500
It doesn't matter if there aren't many, but you can't eat these mushrooms.

144
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,900
This one is poisonous.

145
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,400
And this is Fly Amanita.

146
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,800
Be wary of these two mushrooms.

147
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,900
I think these are Moomintroll and Sniff's mushrooms.

148
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
We did not pick poisonous mushrooms.

149
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,000
You have a little less, but this one is a Panther Fly Amanita.

150
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,600
And what about this?

151
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
Both of you have poisonous mushrooms.

152
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,900
But Ninny has no poisonous mushrooms in her basket.

153
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,500
How has she picked up so many by herself?

154
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Ninny, come here. Where are you?

155
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
Moominmamma, let's make a warrant for Ninny.

156
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,800
Ninny, I would say this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

157
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey, I can see her feet!

158
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,400
Great, Ninny! Soon we will see your face too!

159
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,300
That won't take long. Don't worry about Stinky. He is just nasty.

160
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,900
"Don't think sad things." That's my motto.

161
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,800
And mine is "Bite the person who picks on you."

162
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,900
If someone is so great picking mushrooms they deserve to get fully visible.

163
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,300
Look! We can see her legs!

164
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,100
Ninny, that's progression!
- Congratulations. I can't wait to see you.

165
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,800
Soon it will happen but I don't think grey suits you.

166
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,900
Sleep as long as you wish.

167
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Good night, Ninny.

168
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
Where is Mamma?

169
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,500
What on earth are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

170
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
How do you like this?

171
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,900
It's very pretty.

172
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,700
It's nice to have somebody in the house who uses clothes. I wonder how it will look on her.

173
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,800
What is this?
- A hair band.

174
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Morning, Moominpappa!

175
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Morning. You're early.

176
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,500
Where is Ninny?
- Still asleep.

177
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,900
You're up early.

178
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,000
How much of her is visible?
- Come and see.

179
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
It's like opening a present.

180
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,500
A row of presents. Every day a new one.
- Exactly.

181
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,300
I think this is much more exciting.

182
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,000
Did I hear a door?
- She's awake!

183
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,200
I hope she saw the dress I put out for her.

184
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,900
The dress looks fine.

185
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
Now you know which way to talk.

186
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,900
Yes, right!

187
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,900
Thank you for everything.

188
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
She can talk!

189
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,800
Even if they didn't see her face yet it was a relief to hear her talking.

190
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,600
It feels silly to talk to somebody who doesn't respond and then you're more likely to say something stupid.
