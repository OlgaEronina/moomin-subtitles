1
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Father, I think the wind is opening the knot...
- Yes, go and secure the knot, my son.

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
By your command.

3
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,200
The storm has surprised Moomintroll and his friends on the Hattifatteners' island.

4
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:014,000
Moominpappa thought it was not safe to sail back due to the weather, but he was secretly pleased they could stay on the island.

5
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,200
If the Hattifatteners' barometer is correct it will show when the rain will stop.
- It can't last much longer now.

6
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,500
Hemulin, I think you should return the barometer to the Hattifatteners after the rain has stopped.

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,900
I won't. And the evil little creatures don't deserve it. Besides I like this barometer.

8
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But Hemulin, you already found lots of new and rare plants. Isn't that enough?

9
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Well, I did find a few, especially the plant with 13 pistils and 3 stamens that I found near the boat.

10
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,200
Moominpappa!
- What?

11
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Unless my poor memory betrays me you told me to tie the boat to a tree...

12
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes I did.
- Oh, that's what I thought... Poor me...

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,100
Did you not tie it up then?
- I thought I did, but...

14
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:42,100
If you didn't then they will only find our bones from the shore.
- We dragged the boat quite far. It should be safe.

15
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I'll go and look.
- Yes Moomintroll, go quickly.

16
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was just about to tie the boat when I found this flower...

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That was close!
- Just in time!

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, Hemulin...
- I wouldn't have thought the waves would come up so high.

19
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,900
Is the water still rising?
- No.

20
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,300
The rain seems to be fading.

21
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Are we doomed?
- The boat was okay.

22
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,600
Wonderful! Was the boat tied up?

23
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes it was.
- Tightly.

24
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,500
Well, that was nice to hear.

25
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
The rain seems to be fading.
- Good.

26
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,400
The barometer shows 780. It means good weather.

27
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,200
And the wind has gone.
- The storm is over.

28
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,100
It's too early to go to bed. I'll take a walk.

29
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,000
It's too dark to see the plants.
- A little walk will ease the tension.

30
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,100
I also need a walk! I'm bored!
- I'll come too.

31
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,900
Hemulin came back!
- They're coming!

32
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Who's coming?
- The ghostly creatures!

33
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The Hattifatteners are here.

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,200
So many... And they all glow...
- They have received an electric charge from the lightning.

35
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,700
What are they doing here?
- They look like they are about to attack us.

36
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They want only one thing.
- What, Snufkin?

37
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,000
I think they are back for their barometer.

38
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Well of course. Listen, Hemulin, be kind and return the barometer to the Hattifatteners.

39
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Yes but...
- All the Hattifatteners are outside.

40
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,500
The situation seems serious.

41
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hemulin, go and give it to them.
- But...

42
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, okay.
- Dad, I'll take it.

43
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,000
Good boy.

44
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,100
Be careful.
- Don't worry.

45
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,400
Moomintroll is courageous!

46
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,800
Here's your stupid barometer. I came to return it.

47
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Moomintroll! Are you okay?
- I guess so. It's lucky we don't have electricity in Moomin Valley.

48
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
My poor hero.

49
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,100
Leave Snorkmaiden alone!

50
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Are you okay? You seem a bit weird.
- I'm okay. I just got scared... Weird smell...

51
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,400
What is it?
- Your hair...

52
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Weird... My bangs! I'm bald! Moominmamma!

53
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Moominmamma! Quick, a mirror!
- Oh Hattifatteners... Where did I put it?

54
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,800
Oh no! My hair is burned!
- Here is a mirror.

55
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm a bald rat! I have to wear a hat or a turban!

56
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:34,000
Rub some oil on your skin and you will get curls.
- I don't want any curls! Everybody will see me looking like this!

57
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,900
I have always liked bald girls.
- Oh come on!

58
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,400
Finally the evil creatures are gone. What's wrong with Snorkmaiden?

59
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My hair... My beautiful hair...

60
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,900
If you get up quickly you can see something...

61
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I wonder where they are going.
- I guess some island that nobody knows about.

62
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:09,000
They are really different...
- Maybe not so much as we are in their eyes.

63
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,500
I would have wanted to see them too! Why didn't you wake me up?
- You were in a deep sleep. You were even snoring.

64
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,300
Hemulin snores! I don't snore ever!
- No you don't.

65
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,900
I don't want to see the Hattifatteners.
- Me either.

66
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,400
The scarf really suits you.
- And the colour too.

67
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Mom, I want to go explore.

68
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Good idea.
- The day suits well for that kind of activity. The storm may have brought something to the shore.

69
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,800
We could go and explore the other side of the island.
- Let's go. There could be new plants.

70
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hemulin! Come already, Hemulin. We are moving too slow.

71
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't wait for me. I have found interesting flowers.
- Well, we will go on ahead.

72
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,900
Very exciting.

73
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Believe it or not but after such a storm we could find anything.
- Like sunken treasure?

74
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,600
Maybe the kind of treasures that don't sink but stay afloat.

75
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll find treasures!
- Hurry up!

76
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
Look how much stuff there is!

77
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Look, a box!... Oh it's too shallow.

78
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Beautiful box. I wonder what's inside... Oh it's empty.

79
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Come... come...

80
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Little My!
- Now what?

81
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Look at how pretty these seashells are!
- Later. I'm searching for sunken treasure.

82
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, what's that?

83
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,000
How pretty these will look on the side of Moominmamma's rose bush.

84
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Wow, I wonder what's in here?

85
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,100
I didn't find anything.
- Don't be so impatient. Look closer.

86
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,900
Snorkmaiden! I found... I found a real treasure! Look!

87
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,100
Oh, it's snowing!

88
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,000
I found it from a small cave.
- It's beautiful.

89
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:43,000
What's that?
- It's a telescope. I'll give it to Dad. It will make him happy.

90
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Well, it's better than my treasures.

91
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Come! You have to come and see what I have found!
- What is it?

92
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,800
Snufkin, where is your treasure?

93
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, what a big lady. I wonder if she's dead.
- She was never alive. She was a figurehead for a boat.

94
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
A real queen.
- I guess so.

95
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,300
She doesn't have a bottom.
- Beautiful.

96
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Let's put it on the front of our boat.
- It's too big. It's from a big ship.

97
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,000
That sank?
- I guess so.

98
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Help me. I want to carry it home!

99
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,000
What would you do with it?
- I will use it as a scarecrow for people!

100
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,600
Help! Come and help!

101
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's Hemulin again.
- I hope there are no Hattifatteners.

102
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,800
Come and help.
- We are coming!

103
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,100
Do you like the wooden queen?

104
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,900
But it's missing a bottom.
- I don't care.

105
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's so fancy about it? The eyes?
- Them too.

106
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,000
What about the hair?
- Yes...

107
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes of course. I've lost mine...

108
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,400
Just a little bit more...

109
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,200
You weigh a lot...

110
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Thank you. You saved my life.

111
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,000
How did you end up in the hole?
- It's a mystery. I was collecting plants when suddenly...

112
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,000
You should have just stuck with the stamps.

113
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Where is it?! Where?! Where?!
- What's missing?

114
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,400
What's lost?
- Oh, heavens!

115
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:33,500
Tell us what's wrong.
- The plant container! Heavens!

116
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't say you left it down there...
- That's what I'm trying to say! Oh heavens!

117
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Are you really getting it for me?
- Of course. You need to calm down.

118
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:05,000
Thank you. I'll reward you. You will get one of my rarities.
- Well thank you. Where's Moomintroll?

119
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,900
There you are. What have you been doing?

120
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,000
He has just been staring at the wooden woman.
- Really?

121
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:26,000
That's not true. But the woman is beautiful.
- But remember that she is wooden. Will you help me?

122
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,000
With what?
- Hemulin lost his plant container down here.

123
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:39,900
It didn't go like that. I fell and somehow the container was left behind.
- I think you have a bad memory.

124
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,500
No I don't! I remember every Latin name of every plant!

125
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,400
I'll go down now. Will you help me when I come back?
- Of course.

126
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,500
I'll help too! Be careful!... Is it there?
- I'm not there yet.

127
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,200
I understand.
- It's here.

128
00:20:0,500 --> 00:20:06,600
Great! Are the plants okay?
- You can see for yourself when I get back.

129
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Now what, Snufkin?
- Wait. I found something.

130
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Our boat is arriving!

131
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,300
Gold.

132
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:43,000
Moominpappa and Moominmamma have come!
- Get Moominpappa! Gold vein!

133
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, Moominpappa will be amazed.

134
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:06,200
Pappa, what will you do with all the gold?
- It's so beautiful it would be a shame to hide it in a drawer.

135
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,500
Let's sprinkle the gold around the rose bushes.
- The bigger pieces. The small ones won't look good.

136
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,500
Some people only see a stupid, legless doll.
- You can hold my glass ball.

137
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,800
No thank you.
- In that case I'll hold it on behalf of you!

138
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:45,000
The people of Moomin Valley decided not to ever get maps or charts. It's much more interesting without them.
