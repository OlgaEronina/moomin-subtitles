1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Snufkin prefers to live on his own.
This year he has set up his tent next to the creek.

2
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
He will stay there at peace with the world until winter.

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,300
MoominTroll sometimes feels lonely and enjoys the company of Snufkin.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Snufkin?
- Snufkin!

5
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,700
He's not here.
- He has forgotten and left to wander.

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,300
Why does he like to be alone?
- I also like to be alone sometimes.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Should we go our separate ways?
- Rather tomorrow.

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,100
We decided to go today.
- Yes we did. You can't sneak out from a mutual decision.

9
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,800
You decided, not me.
- You were there also. You have to come and look for the seashells too.

10
00:02:026,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm already going!

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
It's Sniff!

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where are you going?
- I envy Snufkin.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Why?
- Just because.

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,000
I wonder where he is...

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe we will find something as interesting as the hat.
- Yea it was something...

16
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,000
Did you really throw it in the river? You shouldn't...
- It seemed to be dangerous.

17
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,500
The hat transformed me into a tarsier.
- And the eggshells into clouds.

18
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Yea that was fun.

19
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm going to see if I can find a shell with a pearl!

20
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,000
MoominTroll! Wake up. Snork Maiden is in trouble!

21
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,000
What? What's wrong?
- Snork Maiden fell into Antlion's hole when we were playing tag. Come!

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,500
Push a little more!
- Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Antlion!

24
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Are you trying to mess up my hole?
- No, I'm just leaving...

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Stop immediately! You will scare my prey.

26
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,700
Snork Maiden, is everything okay?
- I just can't reach her.

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,100
I might not be eating ants today.
- MoominTroll help!

28
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,500
Sniff, drop into the hole.
- What? Me?

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't be afraid. I'm here.
- You're tall enough to do this. Go!

30
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm going to eat you all!

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sniff, quick!
- But I...
-- Go now you fool!

32
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Go yourself, fool.

33
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,000
Snork Maiden, grab his foot!

34
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Help, it's my tail!

35
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:51,800
Grab onto me.
- Thank you!

36
00:04:51,900 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you ready?

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
My tail hurts!

38
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I know a secret.
- Tell me.

39
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,500
The Magician's hat has floated to a sandbank.
- Really?!

40
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,000
There's weird things happening.
- Oh no.

41
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,500
You should have thrown it elsewhere.
- Yes. The creek was not a good place.

42
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,000
It's stuck there in the tree.

43
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I don't quite see but the water has turned red.

44
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,100
I think the water has changed into something else.

45
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Let's go get the hat.
- Hopefully the red colour goes away.

46
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,500
Are you going to be okay?

47
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,700
Did you find the hat?
- Yes I did.

48
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Raspberry juice!

49
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,700
What are we going to do with the hat?

50
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,500
We cannot just leave it. You don't know who will crawl into it.

51
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,900
But we can drink raspberry juice whenever we pour water into the hat.

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe the water turned into raspberry juice because it was from this river.

53
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
We should test it.

54
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,300
MoominTroll, you look tired.
- I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

55
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Nonsense!
- What do you mean?

56
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,000
I know what you were doing. I was up too. You were with Snufkin.

57
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,000
You have been dreaming. I'm busy. Thanks for breakfast.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,500
I know what you did. I know!
- It's boring listening to someone explain their dreams.

59
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,000
What's going on?
- It's nothing, MoominPappa.

60
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh he left again...

61
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,500
You don't keep a secret from Little My!

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Snufkin!

63
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
I know who the hat belongs to.

64
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,600
Who?
- The Magician.

65
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,200
The Magician?!
- I just saw Hemulen and he told me he saw The Magician.

66
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,800
I had a dream about a flying witch... 
- On the back of a black panther?

67
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,500
The only thing he cares about are rubies. He searches the world for them atop his black panther.

68
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,700
And when he lost his hat...
- He must have been in Moomin Valley searching for rubies.

69
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,400
I wonder if The Magician has more hats.
- I don't know.

70
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,700
He might not know where he has lost his hat.
- It must be so.

71
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I want to try one thing with the hat.
- What thing? Tell me.

72
00:09:47,000 --> 00:9:56,000
Antlion's aren't worth their reputation.
- It takes hours before they bury themselves into the sand.

73
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,500
It takes only an hour.
- You're lying now...

74
00:10:00,600 --> 00:010:03,700
One hour is a long time to bury yourself in the sand.

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,500
Are you talking about me?

76
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,000
We are talking about how fast you can bury yourself into the sand.

77
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,400
Faster than you can imagine.

78
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,500
MoominTroll said you can do it in an hour but I don't believe it.

79
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Snufkin says that you need hours to bury yourself.

80
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,000
I can show you!

81
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Quite fast. Can't say otherwise.
- Yea that was quick, but she already has a hole dug in the sand.

82
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
No there's not!
- Oh yea?

83
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,000
I can dig myself anywhere. Anywhere!

84
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think this is a good place.
- I think so too. Here, under this rock...

85
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hah! Show me the place!
- Dig here.

86
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,200
Exactly here...
- Time me.

87
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,700
Ahoy! A second and a half!

88
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,700
That's something!
- Yes it is.

89
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,500
I'll sit on top just in case.
- Good. Try now to escape...

90
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
So you caught the Antlion?
- Little My!

91
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,800
I know what you're doing...
- Did you follow us last night?

92
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Of course.
- Have you told the others?

93
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Fool! But wake me up next time.

94
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Or otherwise you will tattle? Is that what you mean?

95
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,400
You'll wake me up because I'm nice.
- Ah, that's another thing...

96
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,000
Look! Water!

97
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,600
I can't see the hat.
- Well, no indeed. Where did you last use it?

98
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,400
What a lot of water...
- I think the sand has turned into water.

99
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
I think the Antlion has turned into something.
- I think so too.

100
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,000
I've sat here long enough. I'll jump off!

101
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,700
I think I can remove the rock myself.

102
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,500
Do we have to help him to get out?
- This is horrifying!

103
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,500
Well, let's get it done.

104
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,400
What has happened to her?
- Let's turn the hat over.

105
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,100
The spring of life!

106
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mother!

107
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hedgehog.

108
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
MoominTroll.

109
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,100
Don't push me.
- Be quiet!

110
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,700
I just saw a magician.
- It must have been him.

111
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Was he looking for his hat?
- I'm afraid so. Did you hide it well?

112
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,400
In the basement.
- Is it a safe hiding place?

113
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Only Little My and I know where the hat is.

114
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,800
A piece of string.

115
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,000
That could turn into spaghetti.

116
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
It didn't turn into spaghetti.

117
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,000
MoominMamma! MoominMamma! You should know one thing.

118
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
What thing?
- There's something going on in the house.

119
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,000
In our house?
- There's a tree growing in the basement!

120
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
Well that's lovely.

121
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What on earth have you done?
- I just put a piece of string into The Magician's hat...

122
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,200
But we threw the hat away.
- We took it back and put it in the basement.

123
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Who is "us"?
- Me and MoominTroll... It sure is growing beautifully.

124
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,400
We have to tell MoominPappa before it's too late.

125
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Come in. The door isn't locked.

126
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Don't worry, just keep on growing. Who would have imagined I was such a green thumb.

127
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Tell me when you need water. And grow fruit soon!

128
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,900
Come in.
- Sorry to disturb you.

129
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,300
What's wrong?
- Bad news.

130
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:45,900
Oh, bad news?
- You should come downstairs to see it for yourself before it's too late.

131
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Too late? Sounds threatening, but don't worry I'll take care of you.

132
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come MoominMamma.

133
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,000
Leave my husband's writing desk alone!
I'm coming, my dear!

134
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Could you bring me the saw? This is a catastrophe!

135
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Unfortunately the saw is in the basement and it is not possible to go there.

136
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,400
Back to the nature then. I'll break the vines with my hands!

137
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, Moomin House!
- Come Snork Maiden, this is fun!

138
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,400
But what has happened?
- I have been gardening.

139
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,400
Catastrophe's shouldn't last this long. I want to have breakfast!

140
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,800
There's a bright side: We don't need any more firewood.

141
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,700
You will learn not to take over the Moomin House just like this...

142
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:28,000
MoominPappa! MoominPappa! Look! Flowers! And fruits!

143
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
MoominPappa, try these...

144
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,900
Horrible!
- Little My has definitely put something into the hat.

145
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
MoominTroll, where are you?

146
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,800
Snork Maiden.
- Oh, MoominTroll, I was afraid you were inside.

147
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Father! Mother! Little My!
- We have to get saws and axes.

148
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,300
Saws and axes are in the basement and we cannot go there.
- I will run for help.

149
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,000
There's no need.

150
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Are you The Magician?
- Yes. I notice that you have found my hat.

151
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,700
It was on the top of a mountain.
- That's weird. I thank that the tree is growing well.

152
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
You shall fade away now!

153
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You have quite a hat.
- Yes, it is. I apologise.

154
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,100
We are thankful that you saved us.

155
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:32,000
That's nice of you to say.
Have you happened to see any unusually large rubies here?
The hat being here seems to be an omen.

156
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Here you go. It was a present from my husband.

157
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,800
It's very pretty, but it's not the king ruby I am looking for.

158
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:56,000
King ruby?
- I've been looking for it for hundreds of years but I cannot find it. I am obsessed with it.

159
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,000
We will light a signal fire if we find it.
- That is very nice of you. I think we will see each other again.

160
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He wasn't that bad.

161
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,200
Let's start to pile the firewood.
- Understood!
