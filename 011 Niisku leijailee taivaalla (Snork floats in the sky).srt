1
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Snorkmaiden is running like the Groke was after her,
probably the fastest she had ever run.

2
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,300
What is going on?

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
Moomintroll!

4
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,800
Moominpappa, help!

5
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,300
Calm down, and tell what is the matter.

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,500
My brother is going to jump off the ledge.

7
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Snork?
- I offended him.

8
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
He said he is going to jump anyway. Moomintroll you need to stop him!

9
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,000
Snorkmaiden, how can I help you?

10
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Snork can't be allowed to jump off the southern ledge.
- He is that type of a person!

11
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Snork is going to do a test flight.
- Oh my God!

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Snorkmaiden, do you mean that your brother's flight apparatus is finally ready?

13
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,100
Oh no, it's probably just a blueprint.

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Well that is something anyway.

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,500
He has built model parts for his future flight gadgets wings, but in my opinion they seem way too weak to keep him in the air.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They could never keep him in the air. Never!

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,100
Alrighty, and now Snork is going to see how his flight gadget's wings are going to work.

18
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
You have to stop his experiment!
- Stop him, Dad.

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:27,700
Did you say southern hill?
- Yes I did. It is steepest and highest.

20
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:35,800
Then we have to move, hurry! There is no time to waste. Come everybody!
- Thank you, Moominpappa, thank you!

21
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,900
Now!

22
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,100
Snork! My only brother!

23
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,300
Stop Snork! Don't jump!

24
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,800
Why have you dragged everybody here?

25
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,100
You are way too young to end your days this tragically. Luckily we got here in time to save you!

26
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,100
Well no you didn't.
- Snork!

27
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
It looks like a dangerous experiment.

28
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,700
Nonsense, I have built these wings by myself!

29
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,700
Good argument but anyway...

30
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,300
I've made exact blueprints of them, and these wings are safe.

31
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Why did you stop so suddenly when you were first running down the hill?

32
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
I was calculating how much speed I need.

33
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,900
Don't jump, Snork. I don't want to lose you!

34
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,300
Stop nagging Snorkmaiden.

35
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,400
Can you really trust in those wings?

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,300
Of course, birds don't fall from the sky either.

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Why you don't try wings closer to the ground? So you won't hurt yourself if you fall.

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,900
I tried already. I jumped successfully from the roof.

39
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Did you happened to see?
- Well no I didn't.

40
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,200
I wouldn't jump in front of a sissy.
- What was that supposed to mean?

41
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,800
It means that I don't want you to stick your big nose up in my business all the time!

42
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,500
Yours is as big as mine! I just don't want to lose you.

43
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Then don't continue.
- Yes I will!

44
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,900
Come on, behave.
- Look out!

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,100
I think that we can't stop your brothers intentions.

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Snork, I think you're brave.

47
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,500
Now let's do this! This time I'll take a better start!

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Is that Snufkin?
- Where is Snufkin?

49
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,400
You won't see him there, get up here!
- Where is he?

50
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Down there. Snufkin!

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,900
Hey!

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did he hear you?
- I don't think so.

53
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,100
Here we go!
- Good luck!

54
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,900
It's going well!

55
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
That's Snork.

56
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Oh, Awesome!
- Do you see Snorkmaiden? Your brother is flying headlong!

57
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Oh he made it!

58
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,200
I was sure he was going to make it.
- To be honest, so did I.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Good, good!

60
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,900
Fantastic! The test flight is going to be a success!

61
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,900
Exactly what I thought! He can't wave and fly at the same time!
- You are lowly.

62
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,200
He will fall if he waves with two hands!

63
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Stinky, you are not needed here. Go away immediately!

64
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
That thing could be useful...

65
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
I will go if you stay.

66
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,200
It would be good for robberies. With that it would be easy to get over high fences!

67
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,600
The wind is taking Snork to the sea.

68
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Why he doesn't turn around and come back?

69
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,500
It could be difficult to change direction.
- He can't turn around?

70
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,700
Of course he can...

71
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Hey, what is this? I can't turn this!

72
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
He crashed into a tree!
- Quickly, help him!

73
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Is he dead?
- No it's just bump.

74
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,300
Oh? Looks dead. Where are the wings?
- Still up there.

75
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Snork has probably gotten tired of those wings already. I will take them!

76
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Well? The test flight went well or...?

77
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah, I guess. Except the end.

78
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm sure that all you need is just more practice!

79
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,700
Well yeah, if you have enough iodine and bandages.

80
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
Hey Snork.
- Yeah?

81
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,900
Are you gonna use those wings anymore?
- What if I don't?

82
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,700
I want them! I want to fly through the sky too! It looks the funnest thing I've ever seen!

83
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,700
The flying features of the wings must be tested more.

84
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,100
Well yeah, that is clear and I could test those for you!

85
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,200
I guess you could help in some way, Moomintroll.

86
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,000
You didn't answer yet. Will I have the wings?
- Yes. Under one condition.

87
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
I will do anything!

88
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:40,800
Now I have blueprints already and the wings are mostly okay to fly. I will need a place to build my gadget.

89
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,100
Yes, you definitely need to.

90
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:54,000
It doesn't need to be fancy. Just a roof over my head so no one could spy or steal my brilliant invention.

91
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,800
You'll have those wings if you help me.
- It's a deal.

92
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,700
I would have helped anyway, but now that I get those wings I will work double effort!

93
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Excellent, it's settled then.

94
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe you will have other avid helpers as well. Snufkin?

95
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Of course.

96
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Sniff, will you help?
- Yeah but I want something too.

97
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
You can borrow those wings!

98
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't want to break them. I'm too heavy...

99
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,900
Don't worry about it. I will try to figure out something.

100
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,900
Something nice! I will gladly help!

101
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Sniff, you are so full of goodness.

102
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,300
I'm sure you are going to need an expert's help to build that forge.

103
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Is this hole deep enough already?

104
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,500
No, we Moomins build things thoroughly and I like to mold cement.
- Okay.

105
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,900
I have thought my head through. You can have my worthless machine building book.

106
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
...Book?
- You don't want it?

107
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you happen to have anything else?

108
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,600
Would you like to have my worthless fountain pen?

109
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I don't write much.

110
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,000
How about my worthless...
- Do you have something that isn't worthless?

111
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:59,100
A gold coin!
-Yea, that sounds something! Oh boy, a real gold coin!

112
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,100
You are digging a really deep hole there. Stop for a moment and come to eat sandwiches.

113
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,600
In the middle of all this?
- Maybe that hole is deep enough already.

114
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,100
Your brother and Sniff are in the forest.

115
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,300
I know.

116
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
Hey Snorkmaiden!

117
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,100
Hey, I'd like to ask something!
- Ask then.

118
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is true that your brother gave those wings to Moomintroll?

119
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,600
Yes. Moomintroll is helping to build a forge in return.

120
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,100
The wings didn't break during that crash?

121
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,500
My brother is fixing them at the moment and I'm bringing lunch to him so move out of my way.

122
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,500
Can your brother really fix those wings?
- He can fix anything!

123
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,500
You need so much lumber.

124
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,900
The forge needs to be bigger than my flight gadget.

125
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Moominpappa and Moomintroll are digging a deep hole.

126
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,000
Everyone is so nice and helpful.

127
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,600
Snufkin is going to go to get nails.
- Excellent. Write him a note for all the other things as well.

128
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,300
Yes dear brother. You are so methodical.
- Famous inventors need to be.

129
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:11,600
The airplane forge was ready in record time. It could be Snork's planning skills or that almost everyone in Moominvalley came to help.

130
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,900
Come in!
- Moomintroll is here!

131
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Come in, Moomintroll.

132
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you for everything. You have helped so much that the wings probably won't make up for it.

133
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Building that forge was fun.

134
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:21,300
I changed the shape of the wings. Now it's easier to rise and land. Also it's easier to turn.

135
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Thank you. I'm so excited that I probably won't sleep much tonight.

136
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,100
When are you going to try wings?
- Tomorrow.

137
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,200
Be careful!

138
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Start practicing close to the ground before getting higher. I would feel terrible if something happened.

139
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,600
Alright!

140
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Where are you going to practice?
- I don't know yet.

141
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Maybe that little hill close to the cliff.
- Good, that is not dangerous. See you there!

142
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,800
Hey, I don't see the wings!

143
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,200
If you came through the patio door you should have seen them. They are on the table.

144
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,900
On the table? There was nothing there.

145
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,200
You were right! My wings have disappeared!
- Of course I'm right.

146
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,700
What has happened to them?
- Someone has stolen them!

147
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,500
What is the matter with you two?

148
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,400
Someone has stolen Moomintroll's wings!

149
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:34,100
Maybe they're not really stolen.
- Yes they are! And I know who took them!

150
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Where should we start looking for the wings?

151
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,100
Stinky!
- You again. That didn't take long.

152
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Stinky, wait! Those wings are mine!
- I knew that you stole them!

153
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,100
Stop you slimebag!
- Don't even think about it!

154
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Wait, I will let you borrow wings later!
- No no, I need these wings to speed up my career!

155
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,400
Look out Moomintroll!

156
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,500
You bugs! With these wings I'm going to be a master criminal!

157
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,900
Stinky is a disgusting bandit.
- You shouldn't have left those wings outside.

158
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:42,100
Who would have guessed that Stinky was going to steal from us. We are his friends. Almost.

159
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
But my coin is safe.

160
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Don't be sad Moomintroll. We will get the wings back.

161
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll punch his nose!

162
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,200
Stinky is drifting to the sea!

163
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey, what is this? Turn around you damned apparatus!
