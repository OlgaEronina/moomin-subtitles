1
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,100
Oh, sorry Moominmamma!
- We were so clumsy.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Oh, it's alright.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Hey, you dropped this!

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Thank you. Are you going out now?

5
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,700
Oh yes, now that the Groke is gone!
- Have fun!

6
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,200
Thingumy and Bob really seemed to make themselves at home in Moomin House.

7
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,500
They are very small and the only ones who can find dropped pencils around the floor.

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey! This looks like an especially secret place!
- Oh yes, nobody can't find it here!

9
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,900
Let's bring the suitcase right here.
- Are you sure we couldn't just keep it in our room?

10
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What if someone goes into the room when we are somewhere else? What then?

11
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,800
The Moomins are not going to go there and sneak around. They are nice.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah but what about guests? The Moomins will let anyone inside the house. Anyone!

13
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
Snorkmaiden!

14
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
You lied to me.

15
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,500
What do you mean?
- Moomintroll still has the shell I gave to him.

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's impossible. Moominmamma gave that to Groke. I saw it!

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,700
I saw that Moomintroll still has the shell.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But was that same one?

19
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
Of course it was! I know it!

20
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
Weird. Moominmamma really did give it to the Groke...

21
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Oh well, I'm going to see Moomintroll right away.  Are you coming?

22
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,100
Coming! Coming! I need to find out the truth!

23
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,800
We will dig it out.
- The whole thing seems really strange...

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,300
That's true.

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Mymble and I went to beach yesterday.
- So what?

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,000
We found an exciting object. Do you remember all that stuff we found after the storm?

27
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,000
Of course I do! It was only couple of weeks ago.

28
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,100
And do you remember that wooden sculpture Snufkin found?
- Yes I remember.

29
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,900
Moomintroll totally fell in love with that thing!
- Don't remind me of it...

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,800
It's here now.
- No it's not!

31
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,000
You have to remember that nowadays I speak the truth and only the truth.

32
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,400
It wasn't changed at all. It was as beautiful as before.

33
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,200
Are you sure it was the same?

34
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,100
Of course it is! Beauty without arms and a butt.

35
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,200
That's true. Just a legless wooden doll!

36
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,900
Beautiful chick with big eyes! Moomintroll is in love with that!

37
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Is it still at the beach?

38
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,200
I think so. Unless someone has found it already.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,900
My, do you think that waves could wash that thing away?

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
I don't know, but those waves did bring it to the beach.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
If Moomintroll finds that statue he will save it.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,400
He will bring it to his room...

43
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Nah, it can't fit through the door.

44
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,000
He will figure something out...
- No! It can't fit!

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh well, I can't foretell that.

46
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,200
And then he will sit and watch that statue with a stupid expression on his face! That damned!

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,000
Snorkmaiden! Weren't you supposed to go to the Moomin House?

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,300
Yeah I was. But I just remembered something important!

49
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Route is clear.

50
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,200
You are not going to leave, are you?

51
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
No! We just, just...

52
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
Then why do you have that suitcase?

53
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,500
Umm, will you help us carrying it?
- Gladly.

54
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Thank you, Moomintroll.
- Don't worry, this is just a small favour.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,300
We are going to take it from here to a secret place.
- Suitcase isn't heavy.

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,100
Oh, sorry! A secret place isn't really secret if I have seen it... I'll leave.

57
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Don't tell anyone about this!
- Of course not.

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
What are you doing up there?

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,300
What does it look like? I'm coming down!

60
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,300
No you can't! You are way too small for that!
- I'll show you that I'm not!

61
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,600
Moomintroll, I would like to ask you something
- Ask away.

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Moominmamma gave your shell to the Groke, didn't she?
- Yes she did.

63
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,200
Then you can't have it because the Groke took it!

64
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,000
I still have it.

65
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,500
But that's not possible in any way!

66
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,200
We gave the Groke a different shell.
- That's a lie! No you didn't!

67
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,900
Okay then. But for Snorkmaiden's sake I will say it was a different shell.

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That is complicated. Tell me the truth!

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,700
It is a secret.
- I wanna know!

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,600
If you tell me that secret I'll tell you mine.
- And what is that?

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,300
It is a secret in a Little My way.

72
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah but what is it?
- You tell first.

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
No, you tell first.

74
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Let's start telling at the same time.
- Okay, let's do that.

75
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
One, two, three...

76
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,500
When I gave the shell to Groke I knew I was going to get trouble and didn't know what to do...
 - I was at the beach yesterday with Mymble and we found that woman shaped figurehead.

77
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,100
What?! That wooden woman?
- Where the cave begins.

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Hey, you didn't tell your secret!
- Later!

79
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,100
Unfair! Tell it right now!

80
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,800
What is Moomintroll doing over there?
- Is he looking for seashells again?

81
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,100
Maybe not seashells, but he is looking for something.
- He seems to have lost something important.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,300
How far do we have to go?
- As far as you can manage to row.

83
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,900
The beach is so far away!
- This old lady needs to be taken so far away that she never comes back! Is that clear?

84
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:14,700
This is far enough already...
- There are still ocean currents! Row it far away, far away...

85
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,400
He looks sad.
- Let's make him happy!

86
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,200
There is only one way.
- You are right.

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Thingumy and Bob.
- You look so sad that we thought that we could try to make you happier, okay?

88
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,400
Is that okay with you?
- It's okay, but you don't have to.

89
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,200
We are going to show you what is in our suitcase!
- Ooh!

90
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,500
Do you want to see it? It's really beautiful!

91
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,400
Of course I want to see it!

92
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you need help?
- No. We can handle this!

93
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Thank you for your help.

94
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,800
Now we are going to open suitcase.
- We are going to open in one, two, three!

95
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
Oooh, by my tail!

96
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,100
Do you like it?
- Oh do I like it?

97
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,800
You are not sad anymore, are you?
- No.

98
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Well that's funny.
- Really funny.

99
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,800
What a ruby! How it changes its colours!

100
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:06,300
From warm red to sapphire blue then pink. Like a flame that flares over and over again and suddenly it has the nuance of a black tulip.

101
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,800
Hmm, maybe that is the king ruby.
- It has to be!

102
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,400
It is the one which the magician is looking for while riding on his panther.
- Oy!

103
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:24,500
He might be somewhere far away right now looking for that ruby but he will come back to Moomin Valley one day.

104
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,700
First Groke and now a magician... Poor little things!

105
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,200
It wasn't even a week before there was a terrible accident at Moomin Valley like lightning from a clear sky.

106
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
It's not in the bedroom either.

107
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,700
That's weird. Where was the last place you saw it?
- Somewhere here...

108
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,100
Maybe it is in the garden.

109
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
I haven't been outside all day.

110
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:10,400
That's right, Moominmamma's purse went missing. In the purse were dry socks, wire, painkillers, and a hand knife for making bark boats.

111
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,200
What is the matter?
- My purse is missing and I feel so helpless.

112
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,600
Will I get a reward if I find it?

113
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Definitely. And I will arrange a big party with cakes and everything and no one has to take an evening bath or go to sleep early!

114
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I'll find that bag!
- No, I will!

115
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,100
Your purse definitely isn't in the cellar.

116
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,900
That's great, dear Snork. I haven't been in a cellar for a day anyway, though.

117
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,100
Word was spreading and soon everyone was looking for Moominmamma's purse.

118
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, there are a lot of people.
- What are they looking for?

119
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,900
What is everybody searching for?
- My purse.

120
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,600
That one with cute little pockets?
- The very same.

121
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,400
You can just go and play.

122
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,800
It is so comfortable to sleep inside Moominmamma's purse!

123
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Moominmamma seems so sad.
- Maybe we should give it back.

124
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,800
You found it! The purse is found! Thingumy and Bob found Moominmamma's purse!

125
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Oh thank you so much! Where did you find it?

126
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh, just somewhere in the bush. Under the big birch.
- Moominmamma's purse is so pretty!

127
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,700
In honor of finding the purse we will have a big party tonight!

128
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:44,000
As you know, this party has been arranged because Moominmamma's purse was found. Thank you to everyone who was looking for it!

129
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll propose a toast for our heroes Thingumy and Bob!

130
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Without that purse there would be something missing in Moomin Valley. Cheers!

131
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,300
Moomintroll has something to say to you.

132
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,400
Um, we are glad that my mother's purse was found and, umm, thank you.

133
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:21,600
As a thank you for this great party, Thingumy and Bob have decided to show us what is in their mysterious suitcase!

134
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,100
We have a unique opportunity for this. Okay, Thingumy and Bob, are you ready?

135
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Ready?
- Ready! One, two, three!

136
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
How wonderful!

137
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,300
How could Groke trade such a jewel for a seashell?

138
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,100
It has to be the king ruby.

139
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
The King ruby!

140
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Magician!

141
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
The ruby that I have sworn to find!

142
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Keep your fingers away! The ruby is ours!
- Go away you mean magician!

143
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,500
That ruby is my property.

144
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,900
No it's not! The Groke traded that for a heart shaped seashell with Thingumy and Bob!

145
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,300
Oh? For a heart shape seashell?
- Oh well.

146
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,000
The Groke gave that ruby to these two. I witnessed it with my own eyes.

147
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,400
I have been searching for this ruby for 300 years.

148
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,100
That is sad. But it's not yours.

149
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Would you change that ruby for two large diamonds?
- No way!

150
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:19,200
I can't take the ruby by force. This really starts to get to my nerves.

151
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:39,800
Would the magician like a mug of punch?
- Thank you. I haven't had punch for 85 years.

152
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Ah, Quince.
- There is that too.

153
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Would you like to have more?
- Thank you, that was enough. Magicians are not big drinkers.

154
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,700
This is a great party and good punch. I will do magic to please you.

155
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll show you magic. You can have three wishes. Please make wishes. Please form a single line to make your wishes.

156
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What now? Are you afraid? You seem too old to be afraid.

157
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,900
Well I'm not afraid. Oh yes, I broke a shovel that I borrowed from Moominpappa. I wish to have a shovel!

158
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,500
Dear Hemulin, not those kind of wishes!

159
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,000
I would like to have a new shovel.
- Then that is what you will get.

160
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Thank you very much!

161
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,600
Thank you for lending this.

162
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,200
Next!
- Sorry but...

163
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,000
What can I do for you, young lady?
- It could be little difficult...

164
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Even for me?

165
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,000
Is that what you want?
- Yes

166
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
Close your eyes.

167
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Your wish has come true, little lady.

168
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,300
Oh my gosh!
- Snorkmaiden!

169
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,800
I wished to have similar eyes as that legless lady that you find so beautiful.

170
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,500
You changed totally!
- Give me a mirror quickly!

171
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,500
Pretty beautiful, actually.

172
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh, terrible!

173
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:46,000
Can I have my old eyes back?
- I'm sorry, only one wish per person.

174
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:00,100
Mister Magician, can I make a wish now?
- Please. Golden carriage, crystal goblet, anything!

175
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:07,000
I would definitely wish for a sack full of gold coins!
- Moomintroll wishes.

176
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,000
Well, ask a two sacks of coins and then I could have the other one. What do you say?

177
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I have already made my decision.

178
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,400
Please, could you be so nice and return Snorkmaiden's eyes back to the way they were?

179
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,500
She sees perfectly with those already! Farewell, golden coins.

180
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,000
Your wish has been heard. And granted.

181
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,500
Well, look!

182
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,400
You should have thought before wishing.
- Oh my Moomintroll!

183
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,700
Ummm, Magician?
- What?

184
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:55,100
If you can make magic that way, why don't you wish yourself a ruby?
- I can't. I can only do magic for others.

185
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,600
Is it okay then if we wish for something together for you?
- That would probably be okay.

186
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let us wish!
- Okay then.

187
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,200
We wish a similar ruby for you!
- Your wish will be granted.

188
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,300
It is for you!
- Thank you, thank you.

189
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,500
And that is how the Magician's 300 year search was finished. And there had never been a party as cheerful in Moomin Valley before.

190
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Everybody was happy. Except maybe Nipsu who wanted sack full of gold coins.
