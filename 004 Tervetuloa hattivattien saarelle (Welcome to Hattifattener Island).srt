1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,700
Moomintroll and his friends were about to have a trip with the boat that they had found from the shore.

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They had not decided the destination yet as it was more fun to travel that way.

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,700
My darling, we will be coming back...
- Let's hope so.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,800
You never know about the sea...
- Well no, but...

5
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,500
We have to build a fire when we get there.
- We can collect wood from the island.

6
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,700
Yes, but it's annoying if it's raining or the island is barren.

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not an adventure then.
- Camping life could be nice too.

8
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,500
Hey! Hurry up!

9
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,300
Moomintroll!
- Hey Snork Maiden!

10
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
You could have fallen!
- Nonsense!

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,200
You should be more careful or you will hurt yourself.

12
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,900
That was good practice. Is your brother coming?
- No, he's too focused on his blueprints.

13
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh boy! We will get to sail with a real sailing boat!

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,200
Is it ready yet?
- It doesn't look like it.

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Are we taking all of this with us?
- Unfortunately yes. It's your mother's idea.

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Moomintroll where are we going?
- That's what we don't know.

17
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,500
Hemulin! Did you find some rarity?

18
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,500
No, I'm afraid I already have this one in my collection... Jeez, are you moving somewhere?
- We're going on a boat trip.

19
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,800
Oh yea? And no one is against it?
- No.

20
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,000
But then why do you need so much stuff?

21
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:42,000
To the sails! Anchor up! To the sails!

22
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Aren't the Moomins here yet?
- No.

23
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,900
Isn't it a lovely day?
- Where are we going?

24
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not decided yet.
- I don't want to go anywhere far.

25
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,900
Why?
- I'm not a good swimmer and if the boat capsizes I would be a burden...

26
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Look at the weather. There's no chance of a storm.

27
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:22,300
Thanks. Everybody on the boat! Moominmamma, My, Snufkin, Snork Maiden, Hemulin. Let's go. 

28
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,100
Are you going too?
- Moominpappa said we could stop on an island and I could collect rare plants.

29
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,400
Hurry up, Sniff.

30
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The boat is full.
- You will also fit.

31
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,000
This will take the whole day.
- I might be the drop that breaks the camels back.

32
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,500
You fool, the boat would carry much more.

33
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,400
Do you see?
- One more can fit. Can't it, Father?

34
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Of course. The sea is almost calm.
- Let's leave it for the next time...

35
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,000
Let him whine on the shore. Let's go!

36
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,500
Sniff will you be okay?
- Why wouldn't I? I think someone has to stay and take care of the Moomin House.

37
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,000
Aren't you so thoughtful. There's cake on the kitchen table.
- Don't worry about me!

38
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Sniff should have come too.
- Sniff is a coward.

39
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,800
He's not a very good swimmer. And he also eats too much.

40
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,900
This is life!
- Yes it is.

41
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,600
Oh, we lost the wind.

42
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We have to start rowing.
- Yes. Snufkin, take the oar.

43
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Row faster!
- I am rowing fast.

44
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,900
We aren't moving.
- Yes we are, but slowly.

45
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I wish you were rowing slaves.
- The current must be against us.

46
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,400
If this goes on I won't find any new plants.
- Throw a hook in the water and collect some seaweed.

47
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:15,200
Wish for the wind. Many seamen have drowned when the sea is serene.
- Look, there is an island!

48
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,000
It's too small to do anything there.
- Not for me!

49
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We are moving even if I don't row.
- The wind has picked up.

50
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Look, a beautiful island!
- And a good looking place to harbour.

51
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I bet there are plenty of unknown plants.
- And beasts and cannibals.

52
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll build an stove so I can start preparing coffee. Someone can go to the shore and look for driftwood.

53
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,900
Father, I will jump to shore with the rope.

54
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,500
These things came in handy.
- We live a comfortable camping life.

55
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,300
Perhaps we are the first ones to visit this island.

56
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,900
Oh thank you!

57
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,900
What else?
- The island should be investigated.

58
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,900
I'll go explore.
- Explore everything.

59
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,500
Are you coming with me?
- I'll stay with Moominmamma.

60
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Here comes wood for the sailors.
- That is a lot of wood.

61
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think the island is uninhabited.
- I wouldn't be surprised. I haven't seen anyone.

62
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,500
But I have.
- Who?
-- Middle sized. White.

63
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What do you mean by "middle sized"?
- Like me.

64
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,000
What did it look like?
- White, as I already said. Like a ghost.

65
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,400
I bet it's just your imagination.
- Don't you believe me?!

66
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
I do. I do believe you think you saw something.

67
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
3 stems and 7 pistils. Interesting foundation...

68
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
And that has to be...

69
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, what a foundation. This island boasts rarities.

70
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, I wonder what that is...

71
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
My dear lord... A barometer. It shows rain and storms. It must be broken.

72
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey, what creatures are you then? Oh, it's your barometer.

73
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,000
Go away! Do not stomp on the plants!

74
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think My has seen a Hattifattener.

75
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,000
Do Hattifatteners look like ghosts?
- Yes they do a bit, but they are harmless.

76
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,700
Someone clearly called for help.
- I bet it was Hemulin.

77
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Ah, go away! Help! Help!

78
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,000
What a lot of Hattifatteners.
- Poor Hemulin.

79
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Help me get down!

80
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,500
What have you done? The Hattifatteners are angry.

81
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,400
Nothing else but knocked on this pole.

82
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't think that is what made them angry.
- I also knocked the barometer to see what the weather is.

83
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe the Hattifatteners thought you were going to steal the barometer.

84
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:31,300
Snufkin, tell them I don't want the barometer!
- How are we going to drive them away?

85
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,900
Hurry up, I'm falling!
- We have to do something.

86
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm thinking...
- Hurry up!

87
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now I know! Hattifatteners cannot hear or see well, but their sense of touch is very good. Rock the pole!

88
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like this?
- Harder!

89
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you see? They feel the vibration. Keep on rocking the pole.

90
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My hands are heavy as lead. I'm falling!

91
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,900
The rocking seems to be effective.

92
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
Are you okay?
- Nasty creatures.

93
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll take their lowsy barometer.
- I don't think that is wise.

94
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,400
This isn't even working.
- How do you know?

95
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,200
It's terrific weather but this forecasts a storm.

96
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,500
Real pancakes instead of canned food.
- I know what's needed for the trip.

97
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Moominpappa knows how to plan everything.

98
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,200
The barometer shows low pressure.
- It will be a storm.

99
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:31,500
A horrible storm... What if the barometer isn't functioning properly?
- Hmm, Hemulin, it might be functioning.

100
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Look at the horizon.

101
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,000
A storm is arriving.
- Better leave before it hits us.

102
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no time. We will be in distress.

103
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:59,500
We will have time.
- It would be a waste to leave so soon. We have not even explored the other side of the island.

104
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,000
I want to explore the Hattifatteners.
- I don't. I definitely don't.

105
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,100
I think we should leave.
- What do you think Mamma?

106
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:18,100
My dear, you are the captain.
- Good. Let me think.

107
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We stay.
- Really?

108
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Hurry up. We need to put up the tent.

109
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,500
A tent?
- Of course. Moominmamma has packed a tent.

110
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,100
Has she? Mother, you're the best!

111
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,400
First we fold the sail and bring the boat onto the beach.

112
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,600
Ready.

113
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,800
I don't think the waves will come this far. Next, the tent. Do not loiter.

114
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:36,000
Poor Hemulin. Maybe this task is too hard for you. Sit there and rest.

115
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm exhausted.
- I'll go to put up the tent. Stay here and rest but when you get up remember to tie the boat to the tree.

116
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,700
You can count on me.

117
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Well let's get to work.

118
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Poor Hemulin...

119
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,800
Oh, I haven't seen this one before...

120
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This one must be rare.

121
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:38,000
Snufkin! How does it look like?
- Above the sea there is a grey curtain. It will rain soon.

122
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
Let's go before we get wet.
No, not yet.

123
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,000
Now what?
- It's so exciting!

124
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,000
It's great to stand here with the sea swirling and watch the approaching storm.

125
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Yea?
- Yea. And at the right time.

126
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,500
So at the right time not to get wet?
- Exactly.

127
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,000
I wonder what the Hattifatteners will do.
- They will wait for the storm.

128
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,700
What for?
- They will become electrified during the storm.

129
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Really? Oh, it's raining.

130
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,300
The hardest rain of my life.
- It won't last long.

131
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Moomintroll, you're dripping wet.
- Thank you.

132
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't be afraid. You'll be safe with me.

133
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The lightning hit close...
- Sure.

134
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The storm is over, Snork Maiden.

135
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,800
An excellent catch of the day.

136
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:32,300
If you are stuck on an uninhabited island you can do nothing else besides wait for the storm to pass.

137
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:43,500
But if the waves and rising water take the boat to the open sea it won't be good.
