1
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,000
Due to last night's thrill Sniff decided to stay overnight at the Moomin house.

2
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,200
Snufkin retired, as usual, to his tent.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Do you remember what had happened?

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,700
The gruesome Groke had followed Thingumy and Bob and everything around the Groke froze.

5
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,900
For Moomintroll the horrors of last night were not yet over.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,100
Help! The Groke is chasing me!

7
00:2:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't come! Leave me alone!

8
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,000
Huh? Why am I laying on the floor?

9
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,500
Good morning Mom!
- Good morning! Has Sniff woken up yet?

10
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Never in a million years.

11
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Where are they?
- In their room still. Those poor things.

12
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,400
Is Dad still sleeping too?
- No. Dad is outside in the yard.

13
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,300
Dad! What are you doing?
- The roses are dead.
- How in the world?

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
These are The Groke's acts from last night.

15
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
The ground around The Groke froze but I wouldn't have believed the flowers would die too.

16
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,500
I wish we could have captured him in an ice cellar.

17
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:52,400
I dreamed that the Groke was chasing me.
- Don't you worry. I think the Groke is looking for Thingumy and Bob.

18
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,500
At least they're not hiding from the fist of the law.
- That might be even more desirable for them.

19
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Aren't Thingumy and Bob coming down?
- They wanted to have breakfast in their room.

20
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Well, what did they tell you? Why is the nasty Groke chasing them?
- Well, they didn't tell me. They just seemed terrified.

21
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
We have to find out.

22
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Moominmamma, bring them breakfast and dig their secrets out.

23
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,700
Who's there?
- It's just me. I'm bringing you breakfast.

24
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
You may come in.

25
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,500
Well? What did they tell you?
- The Groke seems to be after their suitcase and not them.

26
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,500
I wonder what those lilliputians are hiding in their suitcase!

27
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,600
And it seems to be that the suitcase previously belonged to the Groke.

28
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:33,200
Have they stolen it from the Groke?
- That matter didn't become clear. They were very reticent about it.

29
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,000
This is going too far!
- Who knows if we are taking care of dangerous criminals in our home!

30
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Let's ask the Groke!
- Shh! That is out of the question.

31
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,800
We don't want the Groke back here, do we?
- Let's ask the police to ask the Groke.

32
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,400
Let's not bring police into this.
- What should we do then?!
- Don't you shout at me there!

33
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:12,100
Wait for them to open their mouths. If you just pretend to be unconcerned they shall soon reveal their secrets.

34
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,400
They didn't tell anything to Dad and just tiny bit to Mom.

35
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:23,700
We need a woman, but rather someone in the same age group as Thingumy and Bob.
- Of course.

36
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Snorkmaiden! Where are you headed?
- To the Moomin house.
- I'm coming with you!

37
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,200
I thought you lived there.
- Not anymore! My sister came back home yesterday.

38
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,900
How is she?
- She's bossing around and snoring!

39
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Where are you going?
- To see you.

40
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,600
And I was coming to see you.
- And me too.

41
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I brought you a gift.
- A gift?
- Yes, and it's very beautiful.

42
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
What is it?
- You cannot break or loose it.

43
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
Of course not.

44
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Here you are.
- Thank you.

45
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Open it.

46
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Oh, what a beautiful seashell.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was roaming around the beach purposely for you.

48
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,700
Look, you can use it as a mirror.
- True, oh thank you!

49
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm giving my heart to your tender care.

50
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,700
I will caress it. This seashell will always remind me of you.
- Oh Moomintroll.

51
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,500
I will give the seashell a kiss every time I go to bed.

52
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,800
It shall be my most precious gift!
- Besides me.

53
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,800
So I'm supposed to go for a walk with Thingumy and Bob?
- Yes, and don't rush them at all.

54
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,400
They can cry against my shoulder.
- We need to get them to talk.

55
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:07,100
Oh I feel so important and nervous...
- Here, have some tea.
- Thank you.

56
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,300
My, you're not needed here.
- I will dig up their secrets with force if needed!

57
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,300
We are not detectives. We will only speak with them.
- And dig up their secrets! I will be totally silent.

58
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Have you ever tried to be silent?
- Maybe not. I wonder if I should try. I will come with Snorkmaiden!

59
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:47,400
We need a tender and understanding woman here.
- But I am! In a nutshell!

60
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,300
Are you ready?
- I think so.

61
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
It's Moomintroll. I have something to say to you.

62
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,300
This is Snorkmaiden. A tender and understanding girl.
- Hello! Nice to meet you and your friend.

63
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,300
Snorkmaiden wants to talk with you. Will you let her in?

64
00:09:012,900 --> 00:09:17,200
Well, if she necessarily wants. Come on in then.

65
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,900
Shaped precisely like a heart. And so beautiful! I have never seen anything like it.

66
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,500
Do you want something similar?
- No! Seashells like this are one in a million.

67
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,100
Keep it in your purse.

68
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,200
Snorkmaiden will certainly succeed.
- Yeah, they seemed to like her.

69
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,800
The Groke is coming tonight, I can feel it in my bones.
- You're right.

70
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,300
If we only could find out why the Groke is after them.

71
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,900
If that monster comes every night Mom will lose all her flowers.
- Look!

72
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,900
They're going outside.
- Good, good!

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
We need to stop My before she ruins everything.

74
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,900
I will never forgive you if you get yourself into this!
- Don't you intervene in this.

75
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,100
Let's have Snorkmaiden handle this.
- But I'm just shadowing them!

76
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,500
So Snorkmaiden took them for a walk. Where are they now?

77
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't hear a word what they are saying.
- Me neither. We need to get closer.
- Then they'll spot us.

78
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm the only one who is small enough to get close enough.
- Don't go! You'll make Snorkmaiden nervous.

79
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
You're the one making her nervous!

80
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,100
Well then, may I additionally ask...
- You may! 

81
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,700
Does that suitcase belong to you or the Groke?
- Yes it does.

82
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,000
I shall try once more... To whom does that suitcase belong to?
- It's ours!

83
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,200
But to you told Moominmamma that the suitcase belongs to the Groke.
- Yes, it does!

84
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,900
May I ask the same thing once more?
- Ask away!

85
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:08,100
About that suitcase... How is it? Do you own the suitcase?
- No we don't! - Yes we do!

86
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,100
"Don't rush them" says Moomintroll...
- What's wrong?!

87
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Excuse me, but may I ask once more?
- As many times as you like.

88
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh thank you! I'll ask for the last time. Answer truthfully...

89
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,400
That suitcase... - Yes?
...that you have... - Yes?
...is it yours? - It is!

90
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,900
So it's not the Groke's?
- No it's not the Groke's!

91
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,600
At last! Thank the heavens, thank you!
- Thank the heavens, thank you!

92
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Snorkmaiden had it hard.
- I would've said boo and they would've coughed up their secrets.
- Of that I'm sure!

93
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,300
Snorkmaiden is nice!
- All the people in the Moomin house are nice!

94
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:12,100
Do you think they'd want to keep us forever?
- Of course, if we can deal with the Groke!
- Yeah, if we can deal with the Groke!

95
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,600
I won over their trust and now we're good friends.

96
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Who wouldn't be your friend?

97
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,800
Thank you. It wasn't very easy though. They tend to mess things up.

98
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,700
I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't mess things up!

99
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,900
I didn't find out much.
- I should have been handling it!

100
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Snorkmaiden, what did you find out then?
- Well, firstly, the suitcase seems to belong to them.

101
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Why does the Groke then...
- Stop rushing!

102
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,600
The content, on the other hand, belongs to the Groke.

103
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Good heavens. This is a complicated case.

104
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, what's inside the suitcase?
- They wouldn't tell, just that it's the most beautiful thing in the world.

105
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,500
In the whole world?
- The most beautiful thing?

106
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,600
- Ugh! This is so complicated. They don't really look like thieves.

107
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,300
I think we still need to drive the Groke away.
- I don't understand how the Groke can own the most beautiful thing in the world.

108
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,700
Thingumy and Bob told me that the Groke just happens to own it.

109
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,700
The Groke might have stolen the content of the suitcase himself.
- Dear heavens.

110
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,100
Thingumy and Bob are awfully afraid of the Groke's vengeance.

111
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,800
But they still won't give up the content of the suitcase.
- Quite a mess!

112
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,700
The Groke will surely come tonight. What are we going to do?
- The same as last night!

113
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,400
If the content of the suitcase belongs to the Groke we can't just drive it away.

114
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,500
I doubt the Groke will leave as easily this time. If it stays we could be facing an everlasting winter.

115
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:18,700
I will cover my petunias, just in case. Are you staying here?
- I will go to Snork.
- I'm going home!

116
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:26,500
But Snufkin stays. Don't look so gloomy. I have a plan!

117
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,200
What kind of a plan?
- Just one... You'll see.

118
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,600
The Groke is coming! It's already close!
- Maybe Moominpappa will drive it away. 

119
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Your turn, My.
- I know, I know. If you don't have an ace of clubs...

120
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,500
Hm, the Groke's coming now.
- Just as I was about to win!

121
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,500
Go under the table, this might become dangerous!
- Crazy, how can I whack with the rolling pin from under the table?

122
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Is the Groke here already?
- Yeah, at the same spot as yesterday.

123
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll go and stomp it's feet!
- I'll go first. All of you stay behind me.

124
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,600
Moominmamma!
- Yes darling?

125
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,800
You said you have a plan. Wouldn't this be the time for it?

126
00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Listen, Groke. We wan't to talk with you. We know you have come back to collect belongings that Thingumy and Bob have stolen from you, isn't that so?

127
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Would you sell your belonging to them?

128
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,700
Or would you give it for free?

129
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,300
I have beautiful items in my purse. Could we trade?

130
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,000
What do you think about this medallion?

131
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,600
Oh, you don't like it?

132
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
What about this?

133
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,300
Or this?

134
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:06,000
Can't you settle with anything? You can choose anything from my purse, except the aspirins.

135
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you mean this?

136
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,000
Or this?

137
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh dear, this isn't mine actually. Moomintroll, can I give the seashell?

138
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,900
Mom! Are you hurt?
- No. My hand just suddenly froze.

139
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Now that you have the seashell promise to never return. 

140
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't you dare come back!

141
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Huh, that was close. Moominmamma had her senses. Thank you Mamma!

142
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm sorry Moomintroll. I didn't remember your seashell was in my purse.
- It's okay, Mom.

143
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I wonder what Snorkmaiden thinks? You promised to give the seashell a kiss every night or something else as stupid.

144
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,000
Mom did the right thing. Besides, I won't tell Snorkmaiden.

145
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,400
Goof. The truth will always come out. From now on I will always tell the truth.

146
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Moomintroll look, I found one!
- It's very similar but mine was a lot bigger.
- Oh was it a lot bigger?

147
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Moomintroll had to find a seashell that would look exactly like the one Snorkmaiden had given him.

148
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Here it is! Here it is! I found it! 

149
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,500
Look! It's precisely the same!

150
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,500
It was a miracle! But miracles do happen in Moomin Valley.
