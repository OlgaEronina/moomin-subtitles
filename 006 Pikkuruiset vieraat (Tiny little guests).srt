1
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Letters are nice to receive. At least every now and then.

2
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,900
Letters are rare in Moomin Valley, but they have post boxes and even a postman.

3
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Did you call for me?

4
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,900
There's a letter for you.
- Fall in! Fall in!

5
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,600
Now he's coming. Fall in! Fall in!... It worked!

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Did you dig that hole?
- Yes! And it worked!

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Who did this trick?!

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you hurt?
- Did you dig this hole?!

9
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Of course not.
- Then who?

10
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,000
You little!...
- Mr. Postman, can I get the letter please?

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Stop! You annoying bully!

12
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Mother! A letter came.
- My dear! A letter?

13
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,500
From Mymble.

14
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,000
Where's My?
- She is running around somewhere.

15
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Tell me about the letter. It's from my sister Mymble, right?
- I don't know.

16
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:40,000
She went to have a vacation from me, but I guess now she is coming back.
- No she's not if she has any sense. I fell into the hole for the third time.

17
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:49,300
I know. But the first two times I didn't see.
- You are an annoying bully!

18
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,100
I almost fell!
- Good.

19
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,000
You awful child! Nothing good will happen to you!

20
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Mymble is coming back. She feels better now.
- Terrific.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,500
We should go to clean Mymble's house.
- Does Little My know that her sister is coming back?

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,100
No. I think the postman is still chasing her.
- Nevermind telling me why.

23
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,000
MoominMamma, is the letter from Mymble? What is she writing?

24
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,600
After a few days Mymble got back to Moomin Valley.

25
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Mymble is much bigger and calmer than My.

26
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,000
There is Moomin Valley.

27
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,300
Is it full of evil creatures?
- Not that I know of.

28
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,100
Look there is smoke. Smoke means food.
- That is Moomin House.

29
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you on your way to Moomin House too?
- Yes, that's what we thought.

30
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Well that's a coincidence. I'm going there too.

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Your suitcase looks heavy. Do you want me to help carry it?
- No! Never!

32
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, okay then.
- What kind of people live in Moomin House?

33
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,900
Do you plan to stay overnight?
- If they are nice. 

34
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,500
They are very nice. My little sister lives with them.

35
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,200
What's wrong?
- You go ahead.

36
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,900
Fine.

37
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,200
How are you?
- I'm fine. Have you rested up? Come! Everybody is waiting for you!

38
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
By the way, there are two little strangers coming here.
- Here?

39
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes. They are about My's size and carrying a large suitcase.
- I'll make really small beds for them.

40
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,600
Well thanks for the coffee. Come, My, let's go home.
- Not yet...

41
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We have to go and clean the house. The rooms have to be aired out.
- I wiped the floors yesterday and left the windows open.

42
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It must have been easy when you have been asleep most of the time with My.
- I haven't had a chance to bother anybody. Haven't I, MoominTroll?

43
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,700
Uhh huh.
- Dad, what does "uhh huh" mean?

44
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,000
That finally I can hear my thoughts again.
- When My is gone.

45
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go on, knock on the door, Thingumy.
- What if somebody comes and starts to yell?

46
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,500
Maybe they won't open it at all. Go now.

47
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Knock.
- Excuse me?

48
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,000
What got into them? Don't forget your suitcase.

49
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:25,000
What should we do? What what what?
- I won't bite. I'm a local policeman and have served in Moomin Valley for ages.

50
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,000
A policeman! We're not thieves! We're not thieves!

51
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Has somebody accused you to be?
- Hasn't anyone? Didn't you come to arrest us?

52
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Of course not. I'm going to greet the Moomins.

53
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,000
This suitcase is ours.
- Has anybody claimed otherwise? Take it.

54
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ah, you are finally here.

55
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are they your guests?
- I guess so. And they have a suitcase so I suppose they are staying a while. Fun!

56
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,000
Is that okay for you?
- Of course. I am MoominMamma.

57
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,800
I am Thingumy and this is Bob.
- Welcome. Step in and be at home.

58
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,000
I think we can stay... Let's hide the suitcase.

59
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,500
They really are weird.
- Yes they are.

60
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,900
How can I help you today?
- Um, I heard Mymble is back...

61
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes she is.
- Is she coming here?

62
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:09,000
No, she left to go home with My a little while ago.
- Well okay, as a policeman I have to check every small detail.

63
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Well bye then MoominMamma.

64
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,500
He has a crush on Mymble.
- But does Mymble have a crush on him?

65
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know.
- What are the guests doing?
-- Looking scared...

66
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have emptied the drawers for you.
- Thank you.

67
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,900
Where should we put the suitcase?
- Into a drawer?

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It can easily be hid in here.
- Oh look, they have made such cute beds for us!

69
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,100
Let's hide the suitcase in a drawer.

70
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,800
We have to be careful...
- I like the Moomins. They don't scream.

71
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,300
We still have to be careful...

72
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:43,300
Peculiar guests like our house but the two are exceptionally peculiar...
- Yes they're from the north.

73
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,500
And their names are Thingumy and Bob.
- How about the suitcase?

74
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,500
They seem like refugees to me.
- Who try to avoid contact with the police.

75
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,000
Do you want to see them?
- Well I guess so.

76
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Oh there you are.
- What are they doing?

77
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,600
No idea. There was only snoring coming from their room.
- We think that they are refugees.

78
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,500
I wonder what's in the suitcase?
- Money?

79
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,500
Or state secrets...
- Maybe they are arsonists. Let's hide the matches.

80
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,000
The public enemies number 1 and 2. They don't look like it though.

81
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,800
Would you like to have some tea, Snufkin and Sniff?
- Thank you.
-- Cookies too, thanks.

82
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh no, the suitcase is gone! What am I going to do now?

83
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,000
You got up already?
- Oh you were under the bed.

84
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
It's the safest place.
- Something is going to happen soon...

85
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,000
What?
- It woke me up. I feel it's coming.

86
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,600
It can't possibly know we're here...
- Yes it can, and it will come tonight!

87
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Well it's really windy out there.
- And suddenly really chilly too.

88
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,100
Hey, did you sleep well? Come join us.
- There you are! 

89
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,300
This is Sniff and Snufkin. You don't have to be afraid of them.

90
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,900
What's wrong?

91
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,000
It's coming!
- Yes it is!

92
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Who's coming?
- The Groke!

93
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,900
The Groke?!
- It's horrible!
-- Horrible?

94
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,300
The Groke?
- Do you know about it?

95
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,500
I haven't seen it but it's a terrifying monster.
- Terrifying monster?

96
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
And it's following you?
- Yes! It will be here soon!

97
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,900
Don't be afraid. The Groke won't be arguing with me.
- It doesn't? It won't!

98
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,500
But if it's a monster...
- Monster or not, guests will always be safe in Moomin House.

99
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,800
You two go to your room and lock all the doors.
- Thank you MoominPappa.

100
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,300
No one will pass without me saying so.
- No!

101
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Grab your guns, dear family!

102
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,000
Does anyone want more tea?

103
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,700
What's wrong?
- A monster will attack us, MoominMamma.

104
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,300
Dear God!
- MoominMamma, grab your pan in case there is a fight.

105
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,500
I wonder if everyone has a good weapon.

106
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, it's midnight.
- There is no stupid monster...

107
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
I sure hope not.

108
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,500
It's coming! It's here!
- Very close!

109
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:31,900
Nonsense! I will go home. We can't stay up all night.
- Okay.

110
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
I'll go now so you know.
- Watch your back.

111
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Use open roads.
- You're trying to scare me, but I don't scare that easily.

112
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:59,400
It's here!
- No it's not! There are no monsters. A sudden wind blew out the candles!

113
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There's nothing out there...
- Good, so nothing stops you from going home.

114
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:29,800
Admit that no monsters exist. You were just scaring me. Nonsense!

115
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
No one to be seen.

116
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't scramble like that.
- It's here! It's here!

117
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,400
Where?
- Right there! Behind the door!

118
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,500
No, no, don't open the door!

119
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Forward!

120
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:37,900
No one.
- No one? Are you sure?

121
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:51,000
Yea right, no one. We scared it away!
- There it is!

122
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Groke, we would be happy if you would go home.

123
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,000
You make our guests nervous.
- You froze my flowers!
-- Leave Mom's flowers alone!

124
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,000
You must leave before I count to ten. One, Two, Three...

125
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you okay?
- Look at the ground...

126
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Icy.

127
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll be back!
- The voice of The Groke...

128
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Yuck, it's cold.
- Yes, it is.

129
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,900
It won't be back tonight.
- Let's go in and drink something warm.

130
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And it didn't come back, but why was it sneaking around the Moomin House in the first place? And will it come back when everyone is asleep?
