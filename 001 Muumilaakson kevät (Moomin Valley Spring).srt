1
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Have you ever heard of the Moomin Valley?

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
During the winter it sleeps deep in the snowdrifts.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All the rational creatures hibernate when it is covered with snow.

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
This is the Moomin House.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can you see? They are rational creatures.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is MoominTroll. The hero of the story.

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,400
And this is MoominPappa.

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
And this is MoominMamma.

9
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,500
And this one is so little it has to be Little My.

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,000
You never know who you will find sleeping in the Moomin House.

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,900
But now it's time to start the story.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,500
It might become boring if everyone is asleep.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's jump right to the spring time...

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
Spring! Spring has begun!

15
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,200
Ahoy everyone! It's spring!

16
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,000
MoominTroll!

17
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,800
Oh, are you awake too?
- Who can sleep while you're making noises?

18
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,700
I shouted because I was excited.

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Tell me one thing...
- Yea, what?

20
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Do you find it amusing to wake other people up?

21
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,700
Well of course!
- I just had a dream that I was living in a watermelon.

22
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,000
You have to get up. The sun is shining.
- Hmph! What's so special about it?

23
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,000
The winter is over. The spring is here. And life is wonderful!

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sleeping is wonderful too...

25
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,500
You told us to wake you up on the first day of spring.
- Did I?

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Can't you remember?
- Not very well...

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,800
You can always go back to sleep if you want to.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No. I'm not tired at all anymore.
- There you go!

29
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,000
Mother!
- Happy spring time, MoominTroll.

30
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,500
MoominMamma! I'm hungry! Do you have watermelon?

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:4:32,000
No, but I have lots of other things. Let's prepare a big breakfast.

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Snufkin is back!

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you used the stairs it would be faster!

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
It wouldn't be half as fun.

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,300
Are you going to your house?
- Yes. It was nice to spend the winter at your place.

36
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,000
Your sister isn't back yet.
- I will still go!

37
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,000
Snufkin!
- Hey MoominTroll.

38
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,400
This year you got back early.
- Could be.

39
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,000
Wasn't your trip fun?
- Yea. It was. But I sensed the spring had begun.

40
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,000
Tell me about your trip!
- Some other time, MoominTroll.

41
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go and wake up Sniff and do something special.
- Sniff doesn't like to be awoken.

42
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I can hear snoring. I'm going to whistle one more time.

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The snoring stopped...

44
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:011,500
Sniff come out! Snufkin is here!
- I want to sleep!

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We are going to do something special.
- Oh, something special?

46
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Maybe climbing on top of the hill is special.
- We could be the first ones to climb up.

47
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,000
On a day like this you should be able to see all of MoominValley from the top.

48
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,800
Good morning!
- Good morning! Are your parents up yet?

49
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mother is. 
- A-hah! That weird habit of hibernating...

50
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,500
We enjoy it.

51
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why do we always have to do something special?

52
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Beautiful!
- Isn't the view splendid?

53
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Yea, there's smoke from the chimney of MoominHouse.

54
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,300
MoominMamma is making something good.

55
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,000
What?
- Someone has been here before us. Look!

56
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Top hat...

57
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hmm, big and black. Who's is it?

58
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,000
MoominPappa could use it on Sundays.

59
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hmm. It's quite bigger than mine. Can you see?

60
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,000
It's difficult to see under this... It's deeper...

61
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
My old hat is better.

62
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's wrong?

63
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The hat seems to have shrunk. I can't get it off!
- Let me help you.

64
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
My head has swollen!

65
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's wrong?
- The hat got stuck on father's head.

66
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,000
Your old hat is stylish enough.
- This isn't mine! The kids found it.

67
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
It sure is beautiful.

68
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,100
What are we going to do with it?

69
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,700
I don't like the hat at all.

70
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Should we throw it out?
- That would be a pity!

71
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you know someone big headed enough?
- I don't. It's good here.

72
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Oh, a trash bin.
- Good guess, Snufkin.

73
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now let's eat breakfast. Come along, Snufkin.

74
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Lovely smell...

75
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm going out with MoominTroll.

76
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,300
Do you want to come along?

77
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Or would you rather stay here?

78
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,800
What? Are you coming or not?...
So you're not coming?

79
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nisku...
- It's almost ready now!

80
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
This year my flying machine is going to be ready!

81
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It still needs a final touch.

82
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,500
I wonder if it's even possible to build the flying machine?
- Of course not.

83
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Nisku has dreamed about building it.
- You can always dream.

84
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm content with smaller dreams.
- So am I.

85
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't you ever stop eating? You probably don't dream about anything.

86
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,000
I dream about an empty cupboard.

87
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,000
Hmm, I wonder who has been eating eggs in here...

88
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,000
It's good that we finally have the trash bin.

89
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,700
What are these?
- They look like clouds.

90
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Don't touch! They might be poisonous!

91
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm floating!
- Lovely!

92
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I want to try too.
- Are you comfortable?

93
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's go!

94
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:37,000
What if you fall down? What if the clouds go high and someone falls down?

95
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey, small cloud, wait for me... I'm falling down.

96
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:09,000
MoominPappa is writing his memoirs.
Lots of things have happened to him.
The memoirs will be vast.

97
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,900
Heavens! MoominTroll!

98
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,700
What on earth are you doing?
- Father, I'm flying! These clouds came from the house.

99
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come closer. I'll save you.
- No need.

100
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,500
Wait! Stop!
- Father, jump on board! 

101
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm afraid.
- Jump or you will fall!

102
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,200
Too late!

103
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,500
Mother, emergency!
- What is it?

104
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,500
Do you know what the kids are doing?
- Yes I know.

105
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:08,500
They are sailing on top of clouds!
- I told them to be careful so they won't fall.

106
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Sniff, are you ready?

107
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,000
I won!

108
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Wait cloud, come back!

109
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,300
Be kind and do not move... Just like that...

110
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Stay still, cloud...

111
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,700
We will play together again, cloud.

112
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Come! Come here, cloud!

113
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
My cloud is vanishing.

114
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,500
That was fun.
- But I haven't had enough yet!

115
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Are MoominTroll and Snork Maiden up there?

116
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Their clouds last longer!
- But they are vanishing too. They should come down.

117
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll start to count. One...

118
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Little My. Do you want something?
- A good place to hide!

119
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Are there good hiding places in here?

120
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,000
No. He will find me in here...

121
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:18,050
MoominTroll has to be in the house.
- I saw him going into the fireplace.

122
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,000
Did you find him already?
- I didn't.

123
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,400
Did you check from the basement?
- Of course.

124
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Did someone just laugh?
- Who?

125
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
I have to go home now.

126
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Is there something wrong?
- Yes. We haven't found MoominTroll yet.

127
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,000
He's so fat he couldn't fit in a good hiding place.

128
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The laughing comes from there!

129
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Here I am!

130
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I think I'm the only one who wasn't found.

131
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,700
Who are you?
- You don't recognize me?

132
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,000
You were looking for me so hard... And couldn't find...

133
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,000
Be kind and introduce yourself.

134
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,500
I see. Is this a new game?

135
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I am Snork Maiden. Who are you?
- I am the King of MoominValley!

136
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,500
You are so ugly you can't be a king.
- That was unfriendly. Wasn't it, father?

137
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,000
Do you know where MoominTroll is?
- I'm here.

138
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Where?
- Here.

139
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,000
Now you really have to say who you are!

140
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,300
Father...
- I am not your father.

141
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes you are. I am MoominTroll.
- MoominTroll is kind and handsome. Unlike you.

142
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
Have you seen yourself in the mirror?

143
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,000
What does this mean? My snout is gone!

144
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm all furry and my tail thick and furry!

145
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm dreaming! This can't be true!

146
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,500
This is too much!

147
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,000
What are you screaming about? What has happened?

148
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Mother!
- What on earth...

149
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
He claims to be MoominTroll.

150
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,000
Is this really my Moomin child?
- I am! I really am! Don't you believe?

151
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,200
Are you?
- I might have changed somehow!

152
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Calm down. There's nothing to worry about if you really are MoominTroll.

153
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Say it if you really think I am MoominTroll. I don't know what to think about this but I really am MoominTroll!

154
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Mother, say it, I'm your own MoominTroll. Say it!

155
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't I recognize my own child?

156
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You really are my own Moomin child.
- Oh mother!

157
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh MoominTroll...

158
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,300
Father...

159
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Poor MoominTroll. Where did you go to hide?
- The hat...

160
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Better get rid of the hat.

161
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,600
Because everyone wanted to keep their present form of existence they decided to get rid of the hat.

162
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,500
MoominTroll was not fully content with the decision. You don't find a hat like that every day.
